From 20 June to 8 July, 2022, [The Johannesburg Institute for Advanced Study
(JIAS)](https://jias.joburg/) and [The Institute for Pan-African Thought and Conversation
(IPATC)](https://ipatc.joburg) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at JIAS in a hybrid format*. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers interested in critical computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The SICSS-JIAS/IPATC instructional programme will involve lectures, group problem sets and participant-led research projects. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning and ethics. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings and contexts. Speakers will touch on topics such as artificial intelligence in Africa, equity, ethics, decolonisation and algorithmic justice. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organisers, other participants and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to registered masters and doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers and researchers working outside of academia. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Approximately 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire three-week programme.

**Application materials are due 11:59pm SAST (GMT+2) on ~~Thursday, 31 March, 2022~~**

**Monday, 4 April, 2022.**

*Due to the uncertainties brought on by the pandemic the structure of events is subject to change.
We hope to follow a hybrid format. The first two weeks will take place online. The third week
will combine remote and in-person participation. Limited transport and accommodation grants are
available for participants outside of Johannesburg.*
