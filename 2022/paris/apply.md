# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is **restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career-stage faculties from Europe and Africa. Advanced Master students may also apply.** We explicitly encourage applicants from all backgrounds, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.*

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across different levels of technical experience. The **language of instruction will be English**, for which we require a good reading and speaking command. Participants **need to be familiar with at least one scripting language** before the meeting. **Courses will be mostly taught in R.** Participants with little experience with coding in R are expected to complete a SICSS training program upfront. Participants with less experience with social science research are expected to complete additional readings in advance of the summer institute (material will be provided). 

In addition to experience with/interest in CSS, we shall evaluate applicants along several dimensions:
Research and teaching in the area of computational social science
Contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
Likelihood to benefit from participation
Likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
Potential to disseminate computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

When selecting the applications, we will take into account the applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.


## How To Apply

**In order to be guaranteed consideration, all application materials must be submitted by February 28, 2022.** All application materials must be submitted through the **following Google Form \[insert link\]**. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by March 15, 2022, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to SICSSParis@gmail.com.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Paris. Then, if you were to be rejected, you could apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an application under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Paris if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we receive far more applications than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
