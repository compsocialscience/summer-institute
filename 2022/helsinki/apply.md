# Apply

## Eligibility

We do not have specific eligibility criteria for participants: there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.
About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience.
Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute.
Participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language.
Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along several dimensions:

 1. research and teaching in computational social science
 1. contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
 1. likelihood to benefit from participation and potential for high impact research
 1. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
 1. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Due to the fluctuating COVID situation and potential changes in travel policies, we have chosen to keep SICSS Helsinki online this year.
We do our best to accommodate for various timezones during the two-week period.
We have also developed various mechanism to support engagement and peer-interaction to make online activities as social and community building as possible
