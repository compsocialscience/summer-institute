From July 18 to July 29, 2022, [Universitas Islam Indonesia] (https://uii.ac.id/) will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science as a hybrid event. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

SICSS-Jogja 2022 has been generously supported by Universitas Islam Indonesia ([Faculty of Industrial Technology](https://fit.uii.ac.id/), [Department of Informatics] (https://informatics.uii.ac.id/), and [Center of Data Science](https://www.instagram.com/cds_uii/?hl=en)) and [qiscus](https://www.qiscus.com/en), a leading Omnichannel Customer Engagement Platform in Indonesia which operates as a B2B Software as a Service enterprise.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to postgraduate students (both Master's and Doctoral degrees), junior/untenured faculty members (without a PhD or within 3 years of their PhDs), postdoctoral researchers, and researchers working at NGOs or government agencies. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20-30 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program either in-person or online.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/jogja/apply) are due Thursday, March 31, 2022, 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).
