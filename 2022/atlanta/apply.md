# Apply

## Eligibility

We invite applications from graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. SICSS-Atlanta is committed to diversity and inclusion in computational social science, and we welcome applicants from groups currently underrepresented in computational social science. About twenty participants will be invited. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20-25 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents:

1) A letter of application explaining your research area and interest in attending SICSS Chicago

2) A publication or writing sample that best represents your research

3) Your CV

4) Graduate students must also submit the contact information of one academic or industry reference (this requirement is optional for postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and industry professionals)

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 30, 2022.** All materials must be submitted through 
[the SICSS-Atlanta Application portal](https://forms.gle/EBFB6rKqbHmN45nn6). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants by e-mail by mid-April, and we will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Atlanta, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Atlanta if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
