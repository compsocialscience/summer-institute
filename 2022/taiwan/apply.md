## Program Goals

SICSS Taiwan aims to create an exchange platform for data science and social science. Its aim is to develop talent through hands-on, interdisciplinary projects. Researchers and practitioners from various fields in social science and data science will collaborate on data-driven projects with positive social impact and for public good.

## Eligibility

Our target audience is data scientists and social scientists who are in academia or industry in Taiwan. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants new to computational social science.

1) Academia: master students, PhD students, post-docs, faculty and researchers  
2) Industry: data scientists with at least one year of working experience  
3) Non-profit： community organizers who are interested in the intersection of technology, computing, data, and society. 

We have 3 days of in-person component. While there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment in our application selection process, there may be travel restriction and quarantine requirements due to COVID-19. 25 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete additional training in R. Learners doing this preparatory work will be supported by organizing team and teaching assistants one month prior to the program

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants new to computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 

- research and teaching in the area of computational social science
- contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
- likelihood to benefit from participation 
- likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 
- potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. 
 
Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
