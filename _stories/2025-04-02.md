excerpt: SICSS Alumni conduct exciting new research exploring how Facebook advertisements can be used to recruit diverse and cost-effective survey samples in the Global South. Focusing on Mexico, Kenya, and Indonesia, the study shows that digital recruitment can yield reliable data at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods—offering a promising tool for researchers working in hard-to-reach contexts.

**Abstract**
Survey research in the Global South has traditionally required large budgets and lengthy fieldwork. The expansion of digital connectivity presents an opportunity for researchers to engage global subject pools and study settings where in-person contact is challenging. This paper evaluates Facebook advertisements as a tool to recruit diverse survey samples in the Global South. Using Facebook’s advertising platform, we quota-sample respondents in Mexico, Kenya, and Indonesia and assess how well these samples perform on a range of survey indicators, identify sources of bias, replicate a canonical experiment, and highlight trade-offs for researchers to consider. This method can quickly and cheaply recruit respondents, but these samples tend to be more educated than corresponding national populations. Weighting ameliorates sample imbalances. This method generates comparable data to a commercial online sample for a fraction of the cost. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of Facebook advertisements to cost-effectively conduct research in diverse settings.
