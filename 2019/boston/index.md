From the evening of Sunday, June 16 to the morning of Saturday, June 29, 2019, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Princeton University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

Because many more people are expected to apply for the workshop than can be accommodated at Princeton, we are hosting a partner site in Boston. The site is organized by former participants of the 2018 SICSS workshop and will feature live streams of the primary location in addition to local speakers. In the afternoons of the first week, participants at the Boston location will also be able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lecture. In the second week, participants will join teams to develop a research project related to computational social science.

There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. One goal of this partner location is to build and expande the network of computational social scientists in the Boston area.

We are inviting applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Meals will be provided during the workshop and we expect to invite about twenty participants. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

Application materials will be due on Friday, March 29, 2019. Note that this is a month after the main application deadline and after decisions about the main location are expected to have been made. If you have also applied to the Princeton location and have not yet heard from them at the time of your submission, please let us know in your cover letter. Applying to both locations will not affect your chances of being accepted to the Princeton location. However, we assume that if you are accepted there, you will not be joining us in Boston.

There is no cost to participating in the Boston workshop. Limited travel subsidies may be available and, depending on interest and funding, we are considering booking a large Airbnb for participants who are not local. Please let us know in your cover letter if this is something you would be interested in.
