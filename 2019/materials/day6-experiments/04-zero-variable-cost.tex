Main sources of variable costs:
\begin{itemize}
\item staff time
\item participant payment
\end{itemize}

Solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automation (your experiments should run while you sleep)
\item Design enjoyable experiments

{\texttt
Dear Professor Salganik,\\ 

I am writing you because I am a prospective Ph.D. student with considerable interest in your research. My plan is to apply to Ph.D. programs this coming fall, and I am eager to learn as much as I can about research opportunities in the meantime.\\

I will be on campus today, and although I know it is short notice, I was wondering if you might have 10 minutes when you would be willing to meet with me to briefly talk about your work and any possible opportunities for me to get involved in your research. Any time that would be convenient for you would be fine with me, as meeting with you is my first priority during this campus visit.\\

Thank you in advance for your consideration.\\

Sincerely,\\
Carlos Lopez
