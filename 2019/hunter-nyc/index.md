The [Silberman School of Social Work](http://sssw.hunter.cuny.edu/ssw/), part of the City University of New York's [Hunter 
College](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/), will host its second [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/) partner location from June 17th, 2019 to June 28th, 2019.

SICSS NYC-Hunter is for both social scientists and data scientists interested in broadening their knowledge and usage of computational social science. 
In particular, this institute targets applied social scientists, practitioners, and scholars who have little to no exposure to computational social
science methods and theories. The aim of the SICSS NYC-Hunter institute is to build a cohort of applied social science students, scholars, 
instructors, and practitioners who can employ computational social science techniques across practice areas and domains. 

The program is open to all interested participants, though we will be unable to provide accomodations for those not already living in NYC or the tri-state area. 
However, we will be able to proivde a modest travel and lodging reimbursement for those who wish to travel from out of town. SICSS NYC-Hunter is sponsored by the Sloan Foundation and
the Russell Sage Foundation. It will be hosted at the Silberman School of Social Work, located at E. 119th street and 3rd Ave.

Participants in SICSS NYC-Hunter will gain hands-on experience in working with computational methods including learning
programming in R and Python, using version control tools like Github, and applying these tools to applied social science research 
problems. The curriculum will consist of a combination of livestreamed lectures and tutorials, group activities and exercises.
We will cover a broad range of computational research topics from text analysis to digital data collection.

A primary goal of SICSS NYC-Hunter is to bring together applied social science scholars, computer and data scientists, as well as practitioners to 
share their strengths and enhance each other's work. Participants will be encouraged to workshop exisiting work, as well as develop new colaborations. There will also be pilot funding avalable. 

There is no cost to participate, and meals during the day will be provided. We will make every effort to support attendance with metro cards and child care arrangements, should there be need. 

To apply, please submit a short application by March 1st, 2019. [View application here](apply)
