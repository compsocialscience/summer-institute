From the morning of Monday, June 18 to the evening of Friday, June 22, the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/) is sponsoring a Seattle partner location hosted at the University of Washington. SICSS is for both social scientists and data scientists, broadly conceived, and the program is intended for graduate students and others doing computational social science research at the University of Washington and in the broader Seattle and Puget Sound area. SICSS-Seattle is sponsored by the Sloan Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and the eScience Institute and the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington. It will be hosted at the WRF Data Science Studio of the eScience Institute.

Participants in SICSS will gain hands-on experience in working with computational methods, and will be pushed to think more deeply about applying those methods to social-science research problems. The curriculum will consist of a combination of livestreamed lectures and guest speakers, local speakers and tutorials, and group activities and exercises. We will cover a broad range of computational research topics from text analysis to digital data collection.

A primary goal of SICSS-Seattle is to bring together scholars from a range of computational and social-science background, to share their complementary strengths and enhance each other's work. Participants who wish to workshop existing CSS work will have the opportunity to do so, and we will provide meeting space and small amounts of pilot funding in the week following the structured program for participants who wish to begin new collaborations.

There is no cost to participate, and meals during the day will be provided. However, we cannot provide support for housing or for travel from outside Seattle. To apply, please submit a [short application](apply) by **Friday, May 4, 2018**.
