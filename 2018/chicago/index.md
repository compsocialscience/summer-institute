From the evening of Sunday, June 17 to the morning of Saturday, June 30, 2018, the Russell Sage Foundation will sponsor the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/) at Duke University and partner sites around the world.  The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).  

**SICSS-Chicago** allows those who are unable to attend the Duke sessions to join an exciting, collaborative community of Chicago-area researchers.  Your Chicago institute will include both live-streamed lectures from the main site as well as additional guest speakers from around local institutions.

Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, experimental design, non-probability sampling, agent based modeling, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. About twenty participants will be invited. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.
**[Application materials](apply) should be received by April 14th, 2018**.
