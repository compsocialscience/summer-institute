# Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from South Africa. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Meals and registration fees are covered. Participants from outside South Africa are welcomed if only they are able to cover their participation costs (tickets and accomodation).


Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.  Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
