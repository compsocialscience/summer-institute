Networks:
What network? (What are the nodes and links? Is it temporal? Are the edges weighted / unweighted? Is it bipartite?) / How was it constructed?
* Migration (nodes: people, places, edges: migratory patterns)
* Co-sponsorship (nodes: congressmen and women, or groups of congressmen and women)
* Firms (nodes: firms or people or unites, edges: connected by downstream / upstream ownership, or shared board membership as an edge)
* Twitter (nodes: users or tweets, edges: weighted by retweet count)
   * Edges are constructed by a shared retweet, follow, mention, hashtags
* State governments
* Citations
* Ideas
* Learning network (nodes: people)
   * Constructed via adoption of ideas, shared learning
* Wikipedia traffic network
   * Presence of link on a Wikipedia page
* Soldiers (nodes: locations or people, temporal)
* Crime network (nodes: criminals, edges: shared crime or co-conspirators)




What’s different about traditional data sources?
* You can analyzing shocks on the network, to better understand downstream effects
* How does the network structure affect the traffic / spread
* Understanding aggregation or thresholding for constructing the networks
* Endogeneity: uncoupling the effects of network structure and the formation
   * Correlation versus causation
   * Rarely independent samples, no i.i.d. sampling
* Identifying “meaningful” network measures -> external validity
