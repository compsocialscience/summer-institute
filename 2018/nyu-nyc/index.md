From Monday, June 18 to Saturday, June 23, 2018, the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science will host a partner location at the Sociology Department at New York University. The purpose of SICCS NYU is to bring together interested graduate students, postdoctoral students and faculty in the New York area. This satellite program is organized by Adaner Usmani, and the teaching assistant is Barum Park. 

The instructional program will involve lectures live-streamed from the main site at Duke University, as well as group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. SICSS NYU will also welcome outside speakers from the New York area who are experts in computational social science research. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. The partner location officially ends on 6/23, but until 6/30 both Adaner and Barum will be available to help students with their research projects. Those who plan to work on projects will also be able to apply to SICSS NYU for some funding.  

Participation is restricted to PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the area. Lunch and coffee are covered, and there is no registration fee. Participants will be expected to complete some additional readings in advance of the Institute and, if necessary, a set of online learning modules introducing them to the R programming language. 

There is no formal application, but space is limited. If you are interested in attending, please <a href="mailto:adaner.usmani@gmail.com">e-mail Adaner Usmani</a>.
