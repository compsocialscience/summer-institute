From the evening of Sunday, the 5th of July to the morning of Friday, 17th of July, 2020, the University of Oxford will be hosting a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived), and is open to those affiliated with departments, centres or institutions both within and outside of the University of Oxford. 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be research talks by speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include: website scraping and digital trace data, text as data, machine learning, non-probability sampling, an introduction to the reproducible workflow, ethics, and geospatial analysis. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. There are no registration fees to attend SICSS-Oxford and meals and refreshments will be provided free of cost for all participants at SICSS-Oxford during the event. For a limited number participants from outside Oxford, we will provide scholarship support to help cover accommodation and travel (up to a set cap). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About twenty-five participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

Application materials are due by Friday the 27th of March, at 23:59 GMT.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: We have decided to extend the deadline for applications until **Friday the 1st of May**, at 23:59 GMT, due to the current circumstances. We continue to monitor the situation, and we will decide on how to proceed by the end of April.
