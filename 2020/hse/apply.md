### Eligibility
### <a name="eligibility"></a>

---

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. There is no registration fee for participating in SICSS-HSE, and [most of the costs will be covered](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/hse/travel). About fifteen participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science, 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others, 3) likelihood to benefit from participation, 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants, 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement of interest (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to such HSE research priorities  as social and educational inequality, well-being, ХХХХХ), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number). All application materials must be submitted through the [Google form](https://forms.gle/8FsSq684n93WM3Gj7). To fill out this Google form, you need a Google account. In order to meet the deadline, we recommend that applicants create their Google account before the deadline (in case they don’t have one).

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted before Monday, March 30th, 2020 at 11:59pm ET.**

Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in mid-April, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to sicsshse2020 at gmail dot com

### Applying to multiple locations
### <a name="applying_to_multiple_locations"></a>
It is allowed to apply to more than one Summer Institute location, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Duke, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.
