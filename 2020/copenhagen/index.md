From the evening of June 14 to the evening of June 26, the University of Copenhagen will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science sponsored by [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.ku.dk) and the [Centre for Social Data Science](https://sodas.ku.dk/). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is open to both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered in coordination with the Duke University site include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. There is no cost to participate, and we will provide lunch on all weekdays of the Institute. Applications are open to all interested individuals regardless of location, but we cannot provide support for travel and lodging in Copenhagen. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

Application materials are due March 29, 2020.
