From January 3 to January 9 of 2021, the SICSS core sponsors and the University of Arizona will sponsor the first Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, a partner site for SICSS. The purpose of the event is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty interested in computational social science. The event is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will be several guest speakers conducting data and social science research in a variety of fields, including communication, linguistics, political science, and sociology. Topics covered include text as data, social network modeling, digital traces and web scraping, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Approximately thirty participants will be selected, and participants are expected to participate in the entire one-week program.

Due to recent events surrounding Covid-19, we are still planning to host an in-person event but will be monitoring the situation closely. Meals will be provided, but participants are responsible for making arrangements to be in Tucson if they plan on attending in-person. We will be making accommodations for virtual participation for those who are not physically in Tucson. 

Application materials are due by July 1, 2020.
