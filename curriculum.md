We provide state-of-the art training in a range of different areas in computational social science from ethics to text analysis and mass collaboration. Below you can find videos, slides, code, and teaching exercises. These lectures assume a basic, working knowledge of the R language. If you do not yet know R, [this resource](https://education.rstudio.com/) is a great place to start. If you are a teacher, the source code for all of our teaching materials is available [here](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/tree/master/2019/materials). Or, check out alternative curricula developed by organizers of SICSS partner sites [here](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/_data/alternative_curriculum.md) that include material in different software languages and for different types of audiences.
