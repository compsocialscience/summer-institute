### Hosting a partner location

Starting in 2018, the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) began including partner locations in order to increase the number of participants. The Summer Institute is two weeks long and parter locations typically involve: 1) live-streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; 2) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; 3) live-streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and 4) participant-led group research projects. This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.

The Summer Institutes are highly modular and the open source curriculum can be adapted to the skills and interests at each location. The minimum budget to support a partner location is about $15,000 but depends on local conditions. Here are some [sample budgets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2BimdmWNLSVYqTmwrEZcQxv3j3LCyU0hQyW0vZYCk8/edit?usp=sharing). If you have more questions about budgeting—or grants that may be available to support partner locations—please contact us at rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
            
In order to ensure quality and consistency, all partner locations must have a former participant of SICSS as one of the local organizers. If you don’t have any SICSS alumni at your organization, you can contact us about finding a former participant that could collaborate with you. For example, in 2019 Matti Nelimarkka (SICSS ‘17) collaborated with Akın Ünver to run a partner location in [Istanbul, Turkey](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/istanbul/)(Kadir Has University).

### Mission and guiding principles

The mission of the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science is to provide open, high-quality training in computational social science to researchers around the world in order to accelerate the growth of the field and ensure that it develops practices that are in the long-term interests of science and society.

As we work toward this mission, we will be guided by the following principles:

- The training provided by SICSS will be free to participants.

- All materials that organizers develop will be released open source.

- Funders and partners will have no impact on content. Our firewall between funding and content will be modeled on high-quality news organizations, such as the *New York Times* and *National Public Radio*.

### Frequently asked questions

##### What if I can’t run the partner location during the scheduled dates?

That’s fine. [SICSS 2018 in Boulder, Colorado]("https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/boulder/") and [SICSS 2019 in Bamberg, Germany]("https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/bamberg/") both happened at different times from the other partner locations.

##### What if I want to host a partner location in a different time zone from other locations?

That’s fine. Each year we have locations spread around the world. A common strategy is to watch the recordings of the lectures rather than the livestreamed version.

##### How can I learn more about what it is like at a partner location?

At the end of each year, we write a post-mortem that describes what went well and what could be better at each of the partner locations. Here’s our [2018 post-mortem]("https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2018/08/07/summer-institutes-in-computational-social-science-2018-post-mortem/").

##### Do you have any sample budgets?

Yes. Here are some [sample budgets]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2BimdmWNLSVYqTmwrEZcQxv3j3LCyU0hQyW0vZYCk8/edit?usp=sharing") for a partner location with 20 participants. However, you will need to adjust the numbers to align with the costs at your location.
