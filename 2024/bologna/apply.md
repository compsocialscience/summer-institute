# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to advanced master's students, Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About twelve (12) participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (all uploads must be in PDF or MS Word document format): (i) Your curriculum vitae (max 2 pages). (ii) A statement describing any current research and your interest in computational social science (max 1 page, single-spaced). (iii) A writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable – please describe the contributions of each individual author (2-3 sentences). 

All applications must include an e-mail and a second means of contact (e.g., alternative email or phone number).

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 25 April 2024, 12 pm (GMT+1).**

Inquiries can be sent to sps.cssc@unibo.it. 

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Bologna, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an application under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Bologna if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
