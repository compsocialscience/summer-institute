From August 4 to August 8, 2024, the Department of Management and Organization at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Center for Science of Science & Innovation (CSSI), and Northwestern Institute on Complex System (NICO) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, in collaboration with School of Communication, to be held at the Northwestern University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures and hands-on data science tutorials. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of fields in academia, such as business, communication and engineering. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, post-doctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in an intensive one-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/chicago/apply) are due by May 1st, 2024.

We will notify applicants via e-mail in mid-May, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to chicago.sicss@gmail.com
