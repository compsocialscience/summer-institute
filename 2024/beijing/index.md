From June 30 to July 12, 2024, Beijing Normal University, along with the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge and Microsoft Research Asia will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Beijing. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve courses, lectures, group discussion, and participant-led research projects, covering topics such as large language models, social media and text analysis, network analysis, psychometrics, and socially responsible artificial intelligence. Students can participate in lectures and sharing sessions by professors from top universities such as the University of Cambridge, Princeton University, Stanford University, Tsinghua University, and top scholars in the field of artificial intelligence from Microsoft Research Asia. Formation of research groups for collaborative research and exploration and project guidance by domain experts, offering insights into cutting-edge research are also be available. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. All students will join the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science community, gaining more development opportunities.

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 50 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. This event is free of charge. The participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses during this event. But we will provide 300 RMB per day*12 days merit-based scholarships for up to 10 participants. Microsoft Research Asia will prepare commemorative gifts for each participant and special awards for outstanding participants.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/beijing/apply) are due 11:59 pm on April 7, 2024 (Beijing time).
