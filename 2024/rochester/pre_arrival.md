# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-University of Rochester 2023.

- Complete the pre-read
- Complete the coding tutorial for Python (if needed)
- Complete coding bootcamp for R (if needed)
- Watch lecture videos
- Prepare your computing environment

Teaching assistants will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.

## Reading

In order to prepare for SICSS-University of Rochester 2024, you should read Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196107/bit-by-bit)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.

## Coding Tutorial for Python

The [Coding Tutorial for Python by Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) is an online tutorial created by Mike Dane to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. It provides a well-rounded introduction into Python.

## Coding Boot Camp for R

The [SICSS Boot Camp for R](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in R so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.

If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- _[Introducing Python](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492051365/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&aaxitk=6c4766d2757dd35661e9002d793683a4&hsa_cr_id=4400412870801&pd_rd_plhdr=t&pd_rd_r=f1a37283-04c1-41d7-9634-596ab888ffe9&pd_rd_w=sYTAF&pd_rd_wg=OhQ70&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_title)_ by Bill Lubanovic
- _[Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130/ref=sr_1_13?crid=RDL2XZ5R5GED&keywords=oreilly+python+for+data+analysis&qid=1641419922&sprefix=oreilly+python+for+data+analysis%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-13)_ by Joel Grus
- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
- [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3), Code Academy.
- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.

Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-University of Rochester 2023 will employ Python. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as R, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists. We can provide support for R; but, for the moment, not for the other languages.

## Lecture videos

SICSS-University of Rochester 2024 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). Therefore, you should watch (some) [videos of lectures](https://sicss.io/curriculum) before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities. More information will be provided later.

## Computing environment

### Programming

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support Python and R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [Python, Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Zoom

SICSS-University of Rochester 2024 is, for the moment, an in-person event; nevertheless, we will use Zoom. You can join Zoom meetings using a phone or computer with a microphone and (ideally) a webcam. This [article](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/professional-video-call-from-home/) contains some helpful advice on how to set up your device and space to improve your Zoom experience. (Note: though the article recommends external microphones and webcams, we DO NOT recommend or require that you purchase any equipment to participate in SICSS. In our experience, the microphones and webcams built into most modern laptops and phones are perfectly sufficient).

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-University of Rochester 2024, you should have an account in the SICSS 2023 Slack workspace. If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials. Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## Office hours

The SICSS-University of Rochester 2024 will host office hours in-person. More information will be shared later.
