  bio: "Faye-Marie Vassel is a STEM Equity, and Inclusion Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University in the GSE and HAI. To better elucidate key factors that contribute to pervasive issues of racial-ethnic and gender inequities in undergraduate STEM pathways, Faye-Marie’s postdoctoral research is centered on employing mixed-methods approaches to investigate how undergraduate students from groups historically marginalized in STEM experience and navigate the culture of STEM in post-secondary institutions. Faye-Marie is particularly interested in helping advance the field’s understanding of how students perceive the norms and practices   of the Computational Sciences (CS)  and how this may interact with the CS identity development of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. With this line of research Faye-Marie aims to contribute to the field's understanding of how the Culture of CS may shape students' decision-making as they pursue Computational Science pathways in the undergraduate context and beyond.  This scholarship is crucial, for there is still much unknown about what social and increasingly shifting political factors may shape equitable post-secondary educational experiences for students from intersectionally marginalized groups in the Computational Sciences (“CS”); students who remain underrepresented and underserved in the Computational Sciences."
