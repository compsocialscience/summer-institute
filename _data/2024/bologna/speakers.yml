  bio: "Rubing is a PhD candidate in sociology at the Sciences Po’s Médialab and at the CREST (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). His research focuses on the transformations of political journalism in France over the last decades, with a special focus on the changing framing of politics-related events in French print media. By combining machine learning (especially natural language processing) and econometric methods, I aim to identify the driving forces accounting for changes in journalistic norms."

  bio: "Alessandra is an Associate Professor of Public Economics at Bocconi University and a member of the Dondena Research Center on Social Dynamics and Public Policy, where she coordinates the newly established Social Inclusion Lab (SILab). Her research relies on a mix of applied theory and empirical methods to explore policy-relevant issues. She uses administrative data to document the extent and explore drivers of gender inequality along the distribution, with a particular focus on the top and on the role of firms. Moreover, she studies the under-representation of women in elite occupations, focusing on politics and academia. To study the sources of inequality in the economics profession, she uses text as data and natural language processing tools to uncover sources of bias."

  bio: "Milena Tsvetkova is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Methodology. She completed her PhD in Sociology at Cornell University in 2015. Prior to joining LSE in 2017, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Social Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. Milena’s research interests lie in the fields of computational and experimental social science. She employs online experiments, network analysis, and agent-based models to study fundamental social phenomena such as cooperation, contagion, and inequality. Her current work investigates the structural conditions under which inequality emerges and worsens when individuals interact in large social groups. In collaboration with computer scientists, physicists, organizational scientists, and game developers, she is working on incorporating gamification to develop new methods for large-scale social interaction experiments online."
