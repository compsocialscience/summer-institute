  bio: "Anders Grundtvig is a Master student at Aalborg University where he study Techno-Anthropology. His field of interest is STS
  (Science and Technology Studies) where he uses digital methods to map and understand human behaviour and social interactions.
  His educational backbone builds on physical fieldworking and theories about interdisciplinarity and user-driven research. This
  backbone has reseantly been combined with digital methods that opens new forms of investigation where the quali-quanti is
  mixed together with digital-analouge research oppunities. He has reseantly been working on the project 'A Field Guide to fake news' that investigated how we can understand the ecosystems of fake news rather than just debunking them when found. And is now working on a project about personal digital data and trust"

- name: Ilse Pit

  bio: "Ilse Pit is a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, at the department of Communication Science. She is broadly interested in how behaviour online might be (or might not be) different from offline behaviour. In her PhD project, she focuses on how people use visual means to express themselves with brands online. Specifically, she uses computer vision and manual methods to investigate brand representation in user-generated content on Instagram. She is further interested in statistics and (increasing) open science practices."
