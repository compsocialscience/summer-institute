  bio: "I am a PhD candidate, expecting to graduate in the winter of 2018. My dissertation focuses on critical military geographies of rural Americans during and after the Great War. Drawing on newly accessible comprehensive individual-level civilian and military data, my research employs the techniques of historical demography and spatial analysis within a theoretical framework of space-time as relative, relational and constitutive to argue that the life courses and relationships of individual soldiers bind home and front and necessitate a more nuanced appreciation of the far-reaching and persistent effects of militaristic ideologies and practices. I have presented portions of my work at the annual meetings of the Social Sciences History Association, American Association of Geographers, and the Population Association of America. My first sole-authored paper, forthcoming in Historical Methods, explores automated record linkage methodologies."

I am broadly interested in applying computational method to understand and solve social science problems, with a special focus on bias, inequality and polarization in digital systems. I am currently working on a project in which I try to identify and understand partisan slant and political polarization in local TV news using large-scale unstructured text data, i.e. the complete transcript of televised news from around 800 TV stations across all US Designated Market Areas for a period of approximately six years (2012~2018). In a previous study, I investigated the co-evolution of attention and content production in online collaborative systems such as Wikipedia. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale natural experiment to study how exogenous content contributions to a Wikipedia article causally affect the attention it attracts and how that attention spills over to other articles in the network."
