  bio: Daniel Larremore is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute at the University of Colorado at Boulder. His research develops statistical and inferential methods for analyzing large-scale network data, and uses those methods to solve applied problems in diverse domains, including public health and academic labor markets. In particular, his work focuses on generative models for networks, the ongoing evolution of the malaria parasite and the origins of social inequalities in academic hiring and careers.  Prior to joining the University of Colorado faculty, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute 2015-2017 and a post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health 2012-2015. He obtained his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2012, and holds an undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis.

- name: Yotam Shmargad

  bio: Yotam Shmargad is a computational social scientist with an interest in political networks and privacy. In his research, he runs experiments, links and analyzes large datasets, and uses natural experiments to study how digital media augment the patterns of connectivity between people – the size, density, and diversity of our social networks - and the implications that these bigger networks have for our social and political lives. Shmargad’s recent projects look at how political candidates can overcome financial shortcomings with Twitter, and how the partisan composition of one’s social network influences the information they choose to share online. Before joining the University of Arizona as an Assistant Professor, Shmargad received his PhD in Marketing from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He holds an MS in Operations Management from Columbia University and a BS in Mathematics from UCLA.

- name: Amanda Stevenson
  image: /2018/boulder/images/AmandaStevenson.jpg
  bio: Amanda Jean Stevenson is a sociologist trained in demographic and computer science methods. She studies the impacts of and responses to abortion and family planning policy. She is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder. In her current research, she uses demographic methods to study the impacts of reproductive health policies, and computational and qualitative methods to study social responses to these policies. At Boulder she leads a team using massive administrative data at the Census Bureau to evaluate the life course consequences of access to (as opposed to use of) highly effective contraception. And she contributes to a variety of ongoing evaluations of reproductive health policies and develops new strategies for measuring fertility with administrative data. Another line of research examines the social responses to reproductive health policies. In a current project, she uses Twitter responses, website content, media coverage, and in-depth interviews to examine the social movement response to Texas' 2013 abortion restrictions. The case provides an opportunity to investigate how social movements negotiate intersectional critiques from within their ranks.
