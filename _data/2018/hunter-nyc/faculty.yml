  of research: (1) identifying the impacts of the U.S. foreclosure crisis on foreign-born Latinos by 
  examining foreclosure mitigation policy; (2) understanding the impacts of algorithmic decision-making 
  in human services (with particular attention to racially marginalized groups), and (3) using Twitter data 
  to understand the lived experience of marginalized communities in the United States.
