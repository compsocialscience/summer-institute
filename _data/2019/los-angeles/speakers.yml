  bio: "Gregory DeAngelo is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economic Sciences at Claremont Graduate University. He works closely with public sector agencies to address pressing questions of criminal justice policy, identifying the causal effects of actions by both legal and extra‐legal actors on public safety. His research ranges from the identification of the effect of judicial and prosecutorial incentives on the outcomes of criminal cases to the impact of law enforcement strategies on human trafficking. At the core of his work is a desire to advance criminal justice reform by identifying the causal impacts of policies, incentives, and actions by legal and extra‐legal actors on public safety, and then generating technologies with the potential to counteract any negative externalities of these actions."

- name: Sam Pimentel

  bio: "Sam Pimentel is an Assistant Professor in the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley. His research centers on methodology for causal inference in observational studies. He develops new ways to form matched comparison groups in large observational datasets using approaches from discrete optimization. These tools allow transparent and interpretable inferences about the effects of interventions, and provide opportunities to study the impact of potential unobserved confounding variables. He is also interested in applying these methods in health services research, public policy, and the social sciences."
