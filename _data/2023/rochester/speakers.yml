In 2017, she was named one of the 'rising stars in digital humanities' from Inside Higher Ed. She is the author of two books. The first, Data Feminism (MIT Press), co-authored with Catherine D’Ignazio, offers a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. The second, An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press), shows how thinking about eating can help to tell new stories about the range of people, from the nation’s first presidents to their enslaved chefs, who worked to establish a cultural foundation for the United States."
