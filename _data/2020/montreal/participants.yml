  bio: "Xavier St-Denis is an economic sociologist currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto, Scarborough. He completed his graduate work at McGill University and spent two years conducting research in the Income Statistics Division at Statistics Canada, where he developed an expertise in the use of administrative and integrated datasets to explore new questions of high policy relevance. His research focuses on labour markets, stratification, careers, organizations, and comparative political economy using quantitative methods. In his most recent work, he explores the drivers of trends in job stability in Canada, the UK and Germany, and the consequences of job hopping on hiring outcomes in different US occupations. In addition, his postdoctoral research builds on work he conducted in parallel to his PhD on the drivers of intergenerational income transmission in Canada. He is currently dedicating some of his time to research on labour market inequality in the context of COVID-19."

  bio: "I studied Political Science and International Relations at Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey, and took a double major in Sociology at the same university. During my education, I also attended various universities such as The Hague University of Applied Sciences as an Erasmus student, Beijing Language and Culture, and University of Oslo for Comparative Social Science Summer School. I hold a Master at the Department of War Studies at King's College London. During my MA, I worked about peace processes in Turkey by evaluating the socio-political steps in this process by attempting to understand governmental responses and the reactions of terrorist actions. I have been research assistant in the Department of Sociology at Yeditepe University since 2016 where I do my doctoral study. I also studied in the department of Politics and International Relations as recognised student at University of Oxford between 2019-2020 for my doctoral studies. My main research areas are political sociology, terrorism studies, sociology of war and social movements. My doctoral research focuses on exploring the institutional responses and counter-terrorism strategies developed by Turkey and the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, 2003 Istanbul and 2005 London terrorist attacks. I plan to defend my thesis in September 2020."

Methodologically, he is interested in using artificial intelligence for the study of human behavior in large-scale social systems. Nima also has a keen interest in data science as an overarching discipline for conducting interdisciplinary research in different aspects of society, politics, and economics. His current research includes a work-in-progress that provides ontological compatibility between sociology and other computational fields such as information science, and data science."
