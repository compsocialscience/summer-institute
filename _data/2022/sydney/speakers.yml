- name: Caron Chen
  image: /assets/images/CaronChen.jpeg
  bio: Dr Haohui “Caron” Chen is a computational social scientist working for CSIRO's Data61. His multidisciplinary background including GIS, remote sensing, machine learning and statistical modelling allows him to build computational models to solve real-world problems at scale. In the early stage of his research career, Caron focused on disaster management, where he analysed 9.7 million geo-tagged tweets and found social media activities geographically correlated with reported damage during Hurricane Sandy. In the past four years, he has been obsessed with the future of work study. He and his colleagues created the Data61 Australian Skills Dashboard: skills.csiro.au

  bio: Dr Andrew Reeson is a Research Team Leader at CSIRO’s Data61. In his research, he applies behavioural science with econometric modelling to address issues of national significance to Australia. After a mis-spent youth taking biology at Oxford he switched to economics in order to focus on some of the more challenging aspects of real-world problems. In recent years he has shifted his focus to the digital economy, including modelling the potential impact of technology on employment and future skills demand. He is also researching how digital platforms should be designed and implemented to support efficient and equitable data sharing.
