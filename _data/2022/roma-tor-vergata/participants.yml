- name: Ariana Mrereju
  bio: "My name is Ariana Alexandra Stefania Mrejeru and I’m 21 years old. Currently I’m a student enrolled in Global Governance B.A. at university of Tor Vergata in Rome. One of my biggest passions is investigating my surroundings and understanding the reasons and the factors influencing specific situations. I value awareness and I think multidisciplinarity is the best way to achieve it. As said before, I’m still a student and so I’m still projecting my future day by day. Now I’m not able to clearly say what I want to do one day, but I can definitely answer what kind of person I want to be in the next few years. I would like to help people, working on society's dynamics. Although I'm still not sure how to do it, I strongly believe in cooperation and awareness as the means to achieve freedom."

- name: Camilla D’Onofrio
  bio: "I am a second-year student from the Undergraduate Degree in Global Governance, at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, currently majoring in Economics and Philosophy. I have attended a classical high school, focusing on humanities courses like Philosophy, Latin, and Ancient Greek. By studying Economics and Statistics, I developed a fascination for applied economic research. I became interested in learning more about decision-making processes and how economics influences them, also considering ethical and psychological implications.  In the future, I would like to pursue a Master’s Degree in Behavioral Economics, with a specific focus on the role played by this field in evidence-based policymaking. In addition, I am presently volunteering as a marketing team leader in Aiesec in Roma Tor Vergata, which has helped me build my leadership abilities and boost soft skills such as public speaking, problem-solving, time management, and teamwork."

- name: Cecilia Lisi
  bio: "My name is Cecilia and I live in Rome, Italy. I consider myself a curious, determined and dynamic woman involved in being an active part in this modern, digital and globalized society. I believe that there are no limits when we talk about knowledge and skills that someone can acquire and that is exactly my goal for the future: never stop learning. By striving for excellence through active leadership, my objectives are to empower others and become a world citizen. Having attended a scientific high school and being part of a multidisciplinary Bachelor (Global Governance) helped me to master many topics from the more philosophical to the more mathematical ones, and I believe that this program would advantage me in the process of upgrading my skills and comprehension not only on the topic to be discussed but also on the field of Behavioral Economics, which I would love to master during my future career."

- name: Eric Shuman
  bio: "I recently completed my PhD student in social psychology at the University of Groningen supervised by Eran Halperin, Tamar Saguy, and Martijn van Zomeren, and am about to begin my post-doc at NYU with Eric Knowles and Harvard University with Amit Goldenberg. My research interests include collective action, emotions, and intergroup power relations. In particular, I am interested in different types of collective action (e.g. nonviolent, nonnormative, violent). My research examines psychological factors that promote support for these types of action, but also the effects and effectiveness of these types of action at motivating historically advantaged groups to address inequality. I study the predictors and effects of collective action both using traditional psychological lab and survey experiments, but also by examining the dynamics and reactions to real-world protests in surveys and on social media."

- name: Esra Saçli
  bio: "My name is Esra Saçlı. I am a senior International Relations student from Istanbul, Turkey. For my studies, I moved to Ankara, where I focused on the social and political history of the Middle East, propaganda, and social theories apart from my regular curriculum. Additionally, during my exchange semester at the Humboldt University of Berlin, I started to be interested in forced migration and R. Due to my background in Economics, the latter inspired me to expand my quantitative research methods by taking small steps in Phyton and R. Therefore, having an opportunity to join the SICSS community and expand my vision in Computational Social Sciences is thrilling for me. I look forward to gaining a solid knowledge of these tools before a Master's degree program, instrumentalizing them in my future research on migration and meeting like-minded fellow researchers. Apart from my studies, I enjoy learning Italian and German, taking photographs, travelling and exploring sound art."

- name: Oriana Milanese
  bio: "I am an Italian student in “Global Governance” at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata.” I have always been interested in social sciences. One of my main purposes has always been to understand how the world works. Before studying statistics, I used to think that numbers were mainly related to natural sciences only, but this subject showed me the importance of quantitative methods in social sciences as well. Furthermore, as an intern in an NGO, I discovered the importance of data to assess the quality and the impact of all those kinds of third sector programs aimed at improving the well-being of people. Thus, these “discoveries” made me think about a future career in the field of public policy and economics. For all these reasons, I decided to join the SICSS in Rome. Learning a new programming language and discovering a new and truly interdisciplinary subject, such as computational social science, will be highly beneficial for my academic and professional future. Last but not least, I can’t look forward to being part of such a heterogeneous class and meeting new people from all over the world!"

  bio: "I am a second year student of the undergraduate degree in Global Governance, an interdisciplinary course of studies in Political Science. I have attended a scientific high school, acquiring a preparation both on quantitative methods but also on the humanistic perspective, and starting to be interested in social sciences. During my bachelor degree, I had the opportunity of attending courses regarding different fields of study: in particular, I started to be interested about economics, with a special focus on the behavioural approach to the discipline and thus on the research on the decision making process of the individual in different contexts and conditions, which I intend to deepen in my future studies. During my undergraduate degree I also have the chance of deepening my knowledge in other fields of research such as statistics and philosophy, which are often the subjects of the books that I read and that I alternate with novels. Aside from reading, another interest that I have developed is writing."

- name: Rebecca Florea
  bio: "I am a first year student of Medicine and Surgery in Tor Vergata. I attended a scientific high school which gave me the basis of the scientific method and a particularly developed scientific mindset. I consider that to face the different kinds of problems of any field of expertise a variety of specific languages to suit the different faces of the problem. These can be achieved only by gaining an interdisciplinary path, so my interests vary from human body, to maths, to social sciences (I attended many United Network activities both as a participant and a staffer) to singing and others. I am looking forward to working and studying with interesting people on the problems given by the SICSS and to learning and discovering aspects of the reality that show the way humans behave, which is one of the most fascinating things for me."
