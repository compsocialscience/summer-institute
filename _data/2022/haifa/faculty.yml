- name: Pavel Goldstein
  bio: "I have completed , Master in Biostatistics and PhD in pain neuroscience. During my PhD studies, I was exposed to the field of pain research that is still overflowed with endless debates about basic questions: how we measure pain? What causes pain? How we treat pain? Completing graduate studies I found myself at the Prof. Tor Wager’s lab, leading projects with a focus on digital solutions for chronic pain. In 2019 I founded Integrative Pain Laboratory at the University of Haifa to gather novel understanding of chronic pain conditions, developing new ways of measuring, preventing and treating chronic pain."
