  bio: "Bryce J. Dietrich is an Assistant Professor of Social Science Informatics in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa. His research uses novel quantitative, automated, and machine learning methods to analyze non-traditional data sources such as audio (or speech) data and video data. These methods are used to understand the causes and consequences of non-verbal political behavior, such as vocal inflections and walking trajectories, especially in relation to descriptive representation and implicit gender/racial bias. His work has appeared in the Nature, American Political Science Review, Journal of Politics, Political Analysis, and Political Psychology. This work has also received grant support from major organizations, like NIH and NSF, and has been covered by popular outlets like NPR, BBC, The Economist, The Washington Post, and FiveThirtyEight. Finally, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois and was recently a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School and Northeastern University."
