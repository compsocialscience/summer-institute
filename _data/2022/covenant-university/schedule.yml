    <br/> 
    Over the last few years, free and open-source tools like R have become increasingly popular in research environments. The R programming language offers analysts a way to perform data manipulation and wrangling, analysis and modelling, and visualisation in one place. R can also be used to develop presentations, reports, books and even websites.
    <br/> In this presentation, the speakers will introduce R as a tool for humanities and social science researchers. We will look at a handful of specific applications of R. We will also introduce the audience to useful resources, communities, and learning opportunities.
    <br/> Finally, we will explore a case study where R was used as part of a PhD study to perform text mining on legal documents. This project also inspired the development of an open educational resource during a mentorship through Open Life Sciences (OLS) that aims to highlight the benefits of using R in the legal profession and research environments."

    Contemporary social sciences aim to be diverse and inclusive, yet traces of historical supremacy persist in scientific practices. One such practice is geographical references in article titles. This presentation will highlight important North-South gaps in knowledge production using more than half a million social science research articles indexed by Scopus (1996 to 2020)."

    The role of investor sentiment in financial markets has been acknowledged in the literature. In particular, previous work suggests that noise traders are often driven by sentiment rather than fundamental information. This presentation will uncover the link between tweet features and market features using 140 South African companies and a dataset of firm-level Twitter messages extracted from Bloomberg from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2020."

    <br/> 
    <br/> 
 For Development interventions to solve current and future crises data must be reliable and of high quality. The reality is, concerns about data validity pose a significant bottleneck for generating theoretical insights into the complexity of issues peculiar to peoples of Africa and the African diaspora. Previous attempts at circumventing data challenges in Africa have relied on surveys, estimates, or models that often do not reflect the reality in many African countries. In order to have a robust discussion, certain questions must be asked: 
 
 - What challenges exist in the collection of precise data?  
 
 - How do these challenges affect how poverty indices and reports are generated? 
 
 - What can stakeholders do to improve data quality?  
 
 - What unique tools are available to collect more precise data that includes the perspectives of the communities studied? 
   <br/> 
   <br/> 
This panel will discuss key challenges in the collection of precise data as well as how these challenges influence how African and African diaspora populations are studied and economic indices are generated. The panelists will draw from their unique expertise and experiences working with different forms of data to critically reflect/challenge current data collection methods, while highlighting innovative strategies for collecting data about Africans and the African diaspora."

    R packages are an ideal way to package and distribute R code and data for re-use by others. In this session, with a live demo, we shall demystify the creation of an R package using automated tools like usethis. We will also uncover why to create a package (or not), how to improve your R package and your package development skills. The session will also highlight how to solve the challenges you will encounter in developing an R package. Lastly, we will discuss how to find your happy place in the world of R package development – as a devoted maintainer of one package or a valued contributor to dozens of packages."
