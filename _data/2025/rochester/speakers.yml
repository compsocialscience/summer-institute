  bio: "Dino Pinterpe Christenson is a Professor in the Department of Political Science at Washington University, a Faculty Affiliate in the Division of Computational and Data Science, and a Research Fellow at the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy. He earned his Ph.D. from Ohio State University and his B.A. from the University of Michigan. Christenson studies American political behavior and quantitative methods, with research focusing on presidential voting behavior, campaign dynamics in presidential primaries and caucuses, the coalition strategies of interest groups, and public opinion and the media environment of institutional outcomes. More broadly, his work addresses electoral behavior, political psychology, political communication, interest groups, and judicial politics. His articles have been published in leading journals such as American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Political Analysis, Political Behavior, and Social Networks. His research has been recognized with several awards, including the Editors’ Choice Article Award from Political Analysis, the Best Article Award from the Law & Courts Section of APSA, and the Best Article Award from Political Research Quarterly. Christenson is also the coauthor of The Myth of the Imperial Presidency: How Public Opinion Checks the Unilateral Executive (University of Chicago Press, 2020) and Applied Social Science Methodology: An Introductory Guide (Cambridge University Press, 2017). His work has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Hariri Institute, and the Dirksen Congressional Center. He has broad methodological interests, including survey research, experimental design, longitudinal and nested data models, Bayesian analysis, social network analysis, and causal inference."

  bio: "Eric Kolaczyk is a Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University, where he also serves as the inaugural director of the Computational and Data Systems Initiative (CDSI). Prior to joining McGill, Kolaczyk was a faculty member at Boston University, where he held several leadership roles, including director of the Program in Statistics, founding director of the MS in Statistical Practice (MSSP) program, and director of the Hariri Institute for Computing. His research lies at the intersection of statistical and machine learning theory and their application to computing and engineered systems, often from a network-based systems science perspective. Collaborating with a range of students and colleagues, Kolaczyk has developed innovative methodologies for design, representation, modeling, inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification—advancing new paradigms for data measurement and analysis. These efforts have addressed practical challenges across diverse domains, including detecting anomalies in computer network traffic, modeling disease progression, characterizing biological mechanisms of action, monitoring epileptic seizures, mapping chemical reaction spaces, and creating one of the first visualizations of the galactic halo."

  bio: "Gourab Ghoshal is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy with a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to joining his current institution, he was a Research Scientist in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University and a member of Harvard's multidisciplinary Origins of Life initiative. Originally from New Delhi, India, Ghoshal earned his BSc and MSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of London in 2004. He completed his PhD in Physics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2009, during which he also attended the prestigious Complex Systems Summer School at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and the Theoretical Physics School at Les Houches in France. Following his PhD, he held postdoctoral positions at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School, and was a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Trained as a statistical physicist, Ghoshal conducts research in complex systems, with interests spanning the theory and applications of complex networks, non-equilibrium statistical physics, game theory, econophysics, dynamical systems, and the origins of life. He is the editor of a book on complex networks published by Springer, and his work has appeared in leading journals such as Nature, Science, and Physical Review Letters."
