  bio: "J. Doyne Farmer is Director of the Complexity Economics programme at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and Baillie Gifford Professor of Complex Systems Science at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford. He is also External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and CEO and Chief Scientist at Macrocosm.
His current research is in economics, including agent-based modeling, financial instability and technological progress. He was a founder of Prediction Company, a quantitative automated trading firm that was sold to UBS in 2006. His past research includes complex systems, dynamical systems theory, time series analysis and theoretical biology. His book, Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World, was published in 2024.
During the 1980s he was an Oppenheimer Fellow and the founder of the Complex Systems Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. While a graduate student in the 1970s he built the first wearable digital computer, which was successfully used to predict the game of roulette. " # add speaker bio here

  bio: "Sanaz Talaifar is an Assistant Professor in Organisational Behaviour at Imperial College London. She studies identity and its intersections with politics and technology using a multi-method approach that combines traditional methods (surveys, experiments) with novel methods (mobile sensing, experience sampling). She is particularly interested in theory-method synergy, wherein novel methods inform the development of theory and theoretical insights inform the development of novel methods. Previously, Sanaz was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Organizational Behavior at Stanford University and received her PhD in Social and Personality Psychology from the University of Texas at Austin. Outside of academia, she has worked in people analytics at Google and in executive search at Egon Zehnder. " # add speaker bio here

  bio: "Mike Yeomans is an Assistant Professor in Strategy and Organisational Behaviour at Imperial College Business School.
In his research, Mike studies the decisions we make in conversation. We are a social species, doing and learning so much with one another. And the things we choose to say can have profound impacts on our relationships in business, and in life. His work explores the many ways that language technology can help us understand and improve our conversational decisions, so that we can better pursue our social goals together."
