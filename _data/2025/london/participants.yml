#  bio: "Daniele is a PhD candidate at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna, where he joined the ERC-funded Collective Minds research group in January 2025. His research focuses on developing advanced agent-based models that leverage large language models to simulate social dynamics and belief propagation across networks. By creating LLM-powered agent simulations, he works to computationally validate social psychology theories and develop new frameworks for understanding collective behavior. His background combines philosophy (Ca' Foscari University of Venice) and data science (University of Padova), with previous research on bias in large language models during an internship at TU Graz."

#  bio: "Ekaterina is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Economics and Data Science at the University Côte d’Azur (France), affiliated with GREDEG and EUR ELMI. Her research combines Digital Economics, Industrial Organization, and Labour Economics to study the technological and strategic dynamics of ICTs and AI, and their implications for labor markets. In her work, she employs computational methods such as network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. Currently, Ekaterina studies the AI ecosystem by examining its dual role as an infrastructure and an information good. In this research, she maps the AI stack using web scraping and NLP techniques, and explore competitive dynamics in the AI industry, with a special focus on the role of open source. Another direction of her research concerns the impact of digital technologies on the future of work. Within the PILLARS project, she studied how emerging digital technologies reshape regional labor markets in Europe and the US, developing novel metrics of technological relevance and adoption, which were released as open-source resources. Before joining the University Côte d’Azur, Ekaterina held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Sussex (UK). She earned a Ph.D. in Economics from Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany) and holds degrees in Economics and Management from the Higher School of Economics (Russia)."

#  bio: "Elena is a PhD candidate at LSE’s European Institute and she is affiliated with the Data Science Institute at LSE. Her research focuses on political behaviour and political identities in the European context. She is interested in how political and civic actions influence public opinion and attachment to political identities. She study these topics with observational causal inference, experiments, and mixed-methods research designs. Prior to her PhD, she obtained a BA in History and Politics (University of Exeter) and an MSc in Social Research Methods (London School of Economics)."

#  bio: "Jialu Ding is a PhD student in Mathematics at King’s College London, supervised by Dr. Izaak Neri. Her research focuses on the dynamics and stability of large ecosystems modelled on random graphs, using nonlinear dynamical systems such as the Lotka–Volterra equations. By extending tools from random matrix theory to nonlinear regimes, she aims to uncover new insights into the conditions that promote biodiversity and resilience in complex systems. She holds an MSc in Complex Systems Modelling from King’s College London, where her dissertation investigated metastable behaviour and delayed transitions in binary mixtures. Her broader academic interests lie at the intersection of statistical physics, phase transitions, and the modelling of ecological and biological complexity."
