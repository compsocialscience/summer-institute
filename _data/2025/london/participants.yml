#  bio: "Daniele is a PhD candidate at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna, where he joined the ERC-funded Collective Minds research group in January 2025. His research focuses on developing advanced agent-based models that leverage large language models to simulate social dynamics and belief propagation across networks. By creating LLM-powered agent simulations, he works to computationally validate social psychology theories and develop new frameworks for understanding collective behavior. His background combines philosophy (Ca' Foscari University of Venice) and data science (University of Padova), with previous research on bias in large language models during an internship at TU Graz."

#  bio: "Elena is a PhD candidate at LSE’s European Institute and she is affiliated with the Data Science Institute at LSE. Her research focuses on political behaviour and political identities in the European context. She is interested in how political and civic actions influence public opinion and attachment to political identities. She study these topics with observational causal inference, experiments, and mixed-methods research designs. Prior to her PhD, she obtained a BA in History and Politics (University of Exeter) and an MSc in Social Research Methods (London School of Economics)."

#  bio: "Jialu Ding is a PhD student in Mathematics at King’s College London, supervised by Dr. Izaak Neri. Her research focuses on the dynamics and stability of large ecosystems modelled on random graphs, using nonlinear dynamical systems such as the Lotka–Volterra equations. By extending tools from random matrix theory to nonlinear regimes, she aims to uncover new insights into the conditions that promote biodiversity and resilience in complex systems. She holds an MSc in Complex Systems Modelling from King’s College London, where her dissertation investigated metastable behaviour and delayed transitions in binary mixtures. Her broader academic interests lie at the intersection of statistical physics, phase transitions, and the modelling of ecological and biological complexity."

#  bio: "Julia M. Schmidt is a PhD candidate in Economics at Université Paris-Dauphine, PSL, where she studies how data and AI are reshaping productivity, emissions, and labour markets. Formerly a Data Scientist at the OECD, she led projects on digital skills and AI adoption. Passionate about bridging data science and economics, she now combines macroeconomic models with real-world data to explore the impact of digital transformation. At SICSS, she looks forward to deepening her computational social science skills and collaborating with peers at the intersection of data, policy, and economic behavior."

#  bio: "Matteo Prandi is a PhD student in Socio-Economic and Statistical Studies at Sapienza University of Rome. His research investigates how emerging technologies, especially GenAI, reshape labor markets and society with a particular focus on evolving media narratives and regulatory frameworks. Drawing on his background as quantitative risk analyst at Euronext, he employs computational methods, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), to analyze large-scale data and better understand the impacts of technological change. Matteo focuses on evaluating AI's societal implications and fostering informed approaches to technology transition through data-driven research at the intersection of technology, policy, and society."
