  bio: "I investigate how digital technologies and platforms shape online health discourse and care-seeking behaviors through a socio-technical lens. Through mixed-method research combining ethnography and computational analysis, I examine how multimodal technologies - particularly video-sharing platforms, chatbots, and robots - influence health communication and community building. My research analyzes how platform architectures, algorithmic systems, and cultural practices intersect with health content creation and circulation, with special attention to potential biases and systematic marginalization of individual narratives. My research contributes to care-centered digital technologies and social media policy design."

  bio: "Soumyajit De is an M.A./Ph.D. student at UC Santa Barbara. His research explores how algorithms function within socio-technical systems, specifically focusing on their role in organizational processes such as recruitment, performance evaluation, and resource allocation. Specifically, he investigates the interactions between human actors, organizational structures, and algorithmic technologies, emphasizing that algorithms are not merely passive tools but active agents shaping and being shaped by organizational norms and human agency. Currently, he is working on auditing the ranking algorithms of gig-work platforms to see if they produce discriminatory outcomes in terms of race, gender, and ethnicity, similar to how humans rank the workers' profiles. He is also interested in evaluating the conditions where ranking algorithms exacerbate and mitigate such discrimination."
