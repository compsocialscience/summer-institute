  bio: "Giuseppe Russo is a postdoctoral researcher at the DLab at EPFL, advised by Robert West, and currently a visiting scholar in the SALT group at Stanford University, working with Diyi Yang. His research investigates how data-driven methods can help us understand, simulate, and improve the functioning of communities in digitally mediated environments. He explores this question across high-stakes, high-impact domains, including the effects of content moderation on social media, the implementation of sustainability practices on university campuses, and critical decision-making processes within organizations. To address these challenges, Giuseppe develops and applies methods from causal inference to uncover underlying social mechanisms and leverages large language models to assess how closely AI systems can replicate and support human decision-making."

  bio: "Jonathan H. Chen MD, PhD leads a research group to empower individuals with the collective experience of the many, combining human and artificial intelligence approaches to deliver better care than either alone. Dr. Chen continues to practice medicine for the concrete rewards of caring for real people and to inspire this research focused on discovering and distributing the latent knowledge embedded in clinical data. Before his medical training, Chen co-founded a company to translate his Computer Science graduate work into an expert system for organic chemistry, with applications from drug discovery to an education tool for students around the world. His expertise is regularly featured in popular press outlets with over 100 publications in leading clinical and informatics venues and awards from the NIH, National Library of Medicine, American Medical Informatics Association, International Brotherhood of Magicians and more. In the face of ever escalating complexity in medicine, informatics solutions are the only credible approach to systematically address challenges in healthcare. Tapping into real-world clinical data like electronic medical records with machine learning and data analytics will reveal the community's latent knowledge in a reproducible form. By delivering this back to clinicians, patients, and healthcare systems as clinical decision support, he aims to uniquely close the loop on a continuously learning health system."
