  bio: "Vernelle A. A. Noel, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Computational Design and Director of the Situated Computation + Design Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Her work is at the intersection of craft, making practices, and computation. Using interdisciplinary approaches, Dr. Noel examines technical, socio-cultural, and historical aspects of craft and making to develop new frameworks, concepts, and methodologies in computational design research, practice, and pedagogy. She employs computational tools, methods, and technologies to repair knowledges and techniques, and reveal new possibilities for practices. Dr. Noel’s work has been supported by the Graham Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation, and ideas2innovation (i2i), among others. She is co-editor of the new book, “Critical Computational Relations in Design, Architecture and the Built Environment” with Dr. Yana Boeva and has a TEDx Talk titled, “The Power of Making: Craft, Computation, and Carnival."

  bio: "Corina Paraschiv cumulates fifteen years of experience in the private sector, spanning roles such as analyst, mixed methods researcher and product owner, in addition to her work as assistant researcher on post-surgical wearables and independent researcher on VR and surgery through Carnegie-Mellon University.  Named Top 30 under 30 in IT by the Magazine Les Affaires, speaker of six languages and holder of two masters degrees and a cross-cultural communication certificate, Corina bridges several disciplines through everyday projects.  In the talk at SICSS this year, Corina shares her work with designing an internal application for automated textual analysis classification and the adaptations to classic methodologies required for industry applications.  Beyond her research, Corina explores interdisciplinary connections through creative projects at the intersection of design, movement, arts, technology, and linguistics—finding that these diverse perspectives often inform and enrich her approach to computational science."

- name: "Patrick Park"
  image: /assets/images/cmu25/PP_headshot.jpg
  bio: "Patrick Park is a computational social scientist whose research delves into the structure and evolution of large-scale social networks. His work examines how people form and sustain social ties and how broader social, economic, and environmental contexts influence this process. His research spans several thematic intersections, including social contagion, economic sociology, social psychology, the diffusion of innovation, and social movements, all supported by empirical data capturing population-scale online social interactions. Patrick actively seeks interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from diverse fields, including computer science, applied mathematics, social sciences, and management science. His research has been published in journals such as Science, Social Networks, PLoS One, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, and Big Data and Society. Currently, Patrick is assistant professor in the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Prior to joining CMU, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan and Northwestern University. He earned his doctoral degree in sociology from Cornell University."
