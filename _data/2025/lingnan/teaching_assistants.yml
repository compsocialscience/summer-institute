    Juliana Qi Xuan Yuncg is a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology and Social Policy at Lingnan University, 
    Hong Kong. She obtained her Master of Arts in Survey Research from the University of Connecticut, 
    USA, and a Master of Arts in Integrated Marketing Communications from California State University, 
    USA. Juliana’s research focuses on integrated senior care solutions versus aging-in-place strategies, 
    addressing the housing challenges faced by senior residents in Macau. Utilizing social listening—an 
    AI-powered content analysis method—and in-depth interviews, her work investigates government resource
    allocation, the motivations behind seniors’ relocation decisions, and barriers to transitioning into
    public senior housing. This interdisciplinary approach integrates computational social science with
    qualitative insights, with a strong emphasis on policy application.
