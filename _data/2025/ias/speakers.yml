  bio: "Claudia Acciai is a post-doctoral researcher at ITU Copenhagen, where she is affiliated with NERDS, and she is currently a visiting researcher at the Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science (SODAS).  Her work lies at the intersection of comparative public policy, innovation studies, and sociology of science. In her research, she combines computational and experimental methods with qualitative content analysis techniques. She has been working on quantifying institutional and country-related Matthew effects in science and on scientific misinformation. She is currently part of a research project investigating trends in the usage and prevalence of LLMs across scientific disciplines."

  bio: "Neha Gondal is an associate professor in the department of sociology and the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS) at Boston University. She uses mathematical and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between social networks and culture and its role in the production and maintenance of social inequalities. Dr. Gondal draws on a variety of computational techniques in her work including exponential random graph models, machine learning, multi-level regression models, and agent-based simulations. She has studied disparate contexts including moneylending in Renaissance Florence, inequalities in science and academia, public health in housing developments in Boston, and organizational diversity management."

- name: James Evans
  image: /assets/images/james_evans.jpg
  bio: James Evans is Director of Knowledge Lab, Professor of Sociology, Faculty Director of the Computational Social Science program, and member of the Committee on Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science at the University of Chicago. I am also an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture–novelty, ambiguity, topology–of human understanding. He is especially interested in innovation–how new ideas and technologies emerge–and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of his work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but he is also interested in other domains of knowledge–news, law, religion, gossip, hunches and historical modes of thinking and knowing.
