  bio: "Neha Gondal is an associate professor in the department of sociology and the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS) at Boston University. She uses mathematical and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between social networks and culture and its role in the production and maintenance of social inequalities. Dr. Gondal draws on a variety of computational techniques in her work including exponential random graph models, machine learning, multi-level regression models, and agent-based simulations. She has studied disparate contexts including moneylending in Renaissance Florence, inequalities in science and academia, public health in housing developments in Boston, and organizational diversity management."
