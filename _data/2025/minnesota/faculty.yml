  bio: "Lai Sze Tso is an Assistant Professor at Gustavus Adolphus College, an External Member and 2023 Population Scholar at the University of Minnesota – Minnesota Population Center, a 2025 Teaching and Learning Fellow at the Alpha Kappa Delta International Sociology Honor Society, and an Education Board Member for the American Public Health Association. She uses quantitative and ethnographic research for health advocacy, with a focus on applying social media and health technology interventions to address large scale and community-level challenges. She teaches hands-on workshops and courses to doctors, nurses, health professionals, and community health care workers to target-train skills such as state-of-the-field literature reviews, intervention design, and client-patient technology interphase to improve outcomes. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodology, she works closely with social services organizations and government health agencies to explore pathways to tailor technology usage based on the demographics of client-patient and caregiver populations. She has studied health innovations in international contexts, exploring how youth, health professionals, and sandwich generation caregivers learn, transmit, and utilize technology across in-person, hybrid, online formats in health curriculum and social network settings."
