  bio: "Eaman is an assistant professor of Information Systems at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. 
  Previously, he received a PhD in Social and Engineering systems from MIT IDSS and was a postdoctoral associate at UC Berkeley’s Department of Statistics until January 2024. 
  As a computational social scientist, his research interests span network science, statistics, experiment design, and causal inference. 
  He investigates the structural factors that contribute to the unequal distribution of resources or information within networks, as well as the collective 
  behavior in institutional settings and the mechanisms that promote cooperation or lead to disparities across groups. His work also explores experimental design 
  in networks to detect the causal effects of interventions aimed at changing social norms and examines the impact of AI in business, particularly in the context 
  of human-AI collaboration and its influence on creativity." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "Irene is a scholar in the field of information and communication studies. She researches contemporary knowledge production practices, 
  with a focus on how digital technologies shape and mediate them. Her most recent research work centers on knowledge production in the context of open 
  science and public participation in science. She is an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland College of Information Studies. Previously, 
  she was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where she taught ethics of information technologies and digital curation. 
  She is also a Senior Research Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, at the Harvard Kennedy School, where 
  I co-founded the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review in 2019." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "Doug received dual bachelor’s degrees in philosophy and rhetoric (with a minor in cognitive science) from the University of Waterloo, 
  and an MA in Cognitive Linguistics from the University of British Columbia. He then completed a PhD in Communications in the Network Dynamics Group at the 
  University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication. He is now an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business. 
  As co-director of the Computational Culture Lab, Guilbeault harnesses and builds computationally intensive network- and language-based methods to study 
  how organizational cultures emerge and evolve. His work has appeared in a number of top journals, including Nature, The Proceedings of the National Academy of 
  the Sciences, and Management Science, as well as in popular news outlets, such as The Atlantic, Wired, and The Harvard Business Review. He has received top research 
  awards from The International Conference on Computational Social Science, The Cognitive Science Society, and The International Communication Association." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "Friedo is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Copenhagen where he is also affiliated with the Copenhagen Center for Social 
  Data Science (SODAS) and coordinates the Knowledge, Organization, and Politics research group. His research use computational and experimental methods to examine 
  intergroup relations leveraging digital trace, text, survey, and administrative data. He is particularly excited about exploiting underused data sources, 
  such as Google search data, to study phenomena hard to investigate otherwise." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "Alex is Assistant Professor of Sociology in the médialab at Sciences Po. His research addresses problems in the history and practice of social measurement. 
  A recurring theme in his work is the problem of validating predictive measures of complex and ambiguous theoretical processes. Alex is currently especially interested 
  in methods for validating machine learning-based measures of conflictual culture (e.g. hate speech, stereotypes, supremacy, violence); he also maintains an interest 
  in the disciplinary and organizational dimensions of validation problems generally." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "Dirk is a Professor in the Computing Sciences Department of Bocconi University in Milan. He is interested in the interaction between language, society, 
  and machine learning, or what computers can tell us about language and what language can tell us about society. He is also interested in ethical questions of 
  bias and algorithmic fairness in machine learning." # Add faculty bio here.
