  bio: "Eaman is an assistant professor of Information Systems at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. 
  Previously, he received a PhD in Social and Engineering systems from MIT IDSS and was a postdoctoral associate at UC Berkeley’s Department of Statistics until January 2024. 
  As a computational social scientist, his research interests span network science, statistics, experiment design, and causal inference. 
  He investigates the structural factors that contribute to the unequal distribution of resources or information within networks, as well as the collective 
  behavior in institutional settings and the mechanisms that promote cooperation or lead to disparities across groups. His work also explores experimental design 
  in networks to detect the causal effects of interventions aimed at changing social norms and examines the impact of AI in business, particularly in the context 
  of human-AI collaboration and its influence on creativity." # Add faculty bio here.
