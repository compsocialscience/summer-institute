  bio: "Anne-Marie is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Milan. She studies how changes in the social structure, 
  such as deindustrialization or immigration, alter political life. She is especially interested in how the public perceives these social phenomena and the role of 
  the socio-political context in shaping the public’s response to these occurrences. Her project DESPO, Deindustrializing Societies and the Political Consequences is 
  funded by an ERC starting grant (2020-2026). Working at the intersection of political science and sociology, her research has been published in journals such as the 
  British Journal of Sociology, Comparative Political Studies, and the Socio-Economic Review." # Add faculty bio here.
