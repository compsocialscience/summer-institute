  bio: "Laurie is an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at Bates College in Maine. She is a disease ecologist and marine biologist by training with a background in data 
  science and spatial statistics. The core of her research focuses on spatial and temporal patterns in human and biological systems including disease spread, 
  animal movement, and fisheries management. Her educational work and teaching increasingly focuses on community-engaged and open-access approaches to data science. 
  Laurie’s recent collaborative work, Mapping Ocean Stories, combines oral histories and spatial data to understand how coastal communities adapt to change. 
  In the classroom, Laurie designs and teaches courses in data science and statistics that center ethical inquiry, inclusive methodology, and the pursuit of positive 
  social impact. A cornerstone of her teaching is a series of Community-Engaged Data Science courses in which students collaborate with local organizations to co-design 
  and carry out data science projects that address locally relevant issues. These courses emphasize building equitable partnerships, understanding community needs, 
  and producing work that is both actionable and sustainable beyond the classroom. Students learn not only technical skills in data wrangling, visualization, and 
  modeling, but also project management, communication, and ethical decision-making." # Add faculty bio here.

  bio: "I am a PhD researcher on Criminology at the University of Cambridge, lawyer, master's in Sociology and MPhil in Criminological Research. 
  I am currently investigating police misconduct but I am more broadly interested in criminal justice institutions, collective action and responsibility attribution. 
  I am thrilled by the interplay between structural and individual factors, especially in understanding misconduct in law-abiding institutions systemically. 
  These interests are driven by a general curiosity about obedience-disobedience and order and control in society. 
  I am passionate about both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. I master linear, logistic, and poisson family models and I am currently learning multilevel 
  models. I also programme Large Language Models operations.
