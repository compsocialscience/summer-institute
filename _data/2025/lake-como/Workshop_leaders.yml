  bio: "Beatrice is a Junior Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA) and a core faculty member of the Bayesian 
  Learning Laboratory (BayesLab) at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. Her research adopts an interdisciplinary approach to develop rigorous probabilistic representations 
  of complex phenomena, with a focus on Bayesian nonparametrics and probabilistic machine learning. Her work focuses on deepening the understanding of mathematical and 
  probabilistic structures—such as dependent random measures and multivariate random partitions—while also exploring their application to modeling dynamic systems, 
  including change-point detection and network data analysis. These methodologies have broad applications across various domains, including biostatistics, behavioral 
  sciences, and financial econometrics.
  Beatrice earned her PhD in Statistics from Bocconi University in February 2022. She has held research positions at the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) 
  and the Division of Biomedical Data Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2024, she served as Chair of the Junior Section of the International 
  Society for Bayesian Analysis (j-ISBA) and was honored with the IMS New Researcher Travel Award.
  At SICSS, Beatrice will lead the Workshop “Decoding Connections: A Hands-On Workshop in Network Data Analysis” on July 8th." # Add faculty bio here.
