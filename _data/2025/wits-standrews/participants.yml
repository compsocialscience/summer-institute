  bio: "Keabetsoe Motebang is an MSc student in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing at the University of the Witwatersrand. Her research focuses on the geospatial analysis of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in Lesotho, using advanced spatial modelling techniques such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Geographically Weighted Neural Networks (GWNN). Through this work, she investigates the spatial non-stationarity of environmental drivers of NPP and evaluates the predictive power of local modelling approaches for ecological monitoring and sustainable land management. With a strong passion for geospatial modelling and programming, she enjoys working at the intersection of environmental science, remote sensing, and spatial data science. Her work reflects a commitment to leveraging geospatial technologies to address pressing environmental and development challenges in Southern Africa. Beyond her academic pursuits, she is also dedicated to mentoring and advocating for youth empowerment, particularly in areas related to climate justice and spatial equity."  # Add participant bio here.

  bio: "Sena Adugna Beyene is a Public Health researcher and Assistant Professor at Jimma University, Ethiopia, specialising in reproductive health, biostatistics, and population studies. He holds a PhD in Public Health with a focus on Reproductive Health. His research centres on gender equity and women’s empowerment in pastoralist communities, where traditional norms often limit women’s access to reproductive healthcare. He advocates for the integration of population data into development planning to inform evidence-based policies and interventions. With expertise in demography and applied statistics, he also contributes to population modelling, monitoring and evaluation, and institutional capacity building. He regularly produces policy briefs and advocacy tools that inform national and regional strategies to improve maternal and reproductive health outcomes. Motivated by a strong commitment to social justice, he works to empower marginalised women and promote sustainable, community-based health improvements through research, teaching, and policy engagement."  # Add participant bio here.
