  bio: "Keabetsoe Motebang is an MSc student in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing at the University of the Witwatersrand. Her research focuses on the geospatial analysis of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in Lesotho, using advanced spatial modelling techniques such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Geographically Weighted Neural Networks (GWNN). Through this work, she investigates the spatial non-stationarity of environmental drivers of NPP and evaluates the predictive power of local modelling approaches for ecological monitoring and sustainable land management. With a strong passion for geospatial modelling and programming, she enjoys working at the intersection of environmental science, remote sensing, and spatial data science. Her work reflects a commitment to leveraging geospatial technologies to address pressing environmental and development challenges in Southern Africa. Beyond her academic pursuits, she is also dedicated to mentoring and advocating for youth empowerment, particularly in areas related to climate justice and spatial equity."  # Add participant bio here.
