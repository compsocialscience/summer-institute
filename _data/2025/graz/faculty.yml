  bio: "Why are misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading at an unprecedented rate? 
  What can citizens do to combat hate online? And how can we design social media platforms 
  in such a way that they are conducive to civic discourse? These are questions that we want 
  to answer in our research group. In the past, we have looked at what measures can most 
  effectively prevent coronavirus outbreaks in schools, how resilient the Austrian healthcare 
  system is to disruption, and how a changing understanding of \"honesty\" 
  can explain why politicians in the US are increasingly spreading misinformation. 

  In our research, we rely on computational approaches: we use machine learning to identify
  patterns in large amounts of data, statistical models help us to establish correlations 
  between observations, and computer simulations allow us to run through various scenarios 
  and make policy recommendations. To do this, we often use huge data sets of "digital traces", 
  i.e. data such as posts or reactions on social media platforms that people leave behind 
  when they use the internet.

  In order to answer the important social questions of our time at the interface between 
  society and technology, researchers from many different scientific disciplines must come 
  together. That is why we are an interdisciplinary team with expertise ranging from computer 
  science, sociology and psychology to physics. We welcome people with a technical background
  who are interested in social issues as well as students and researchers from the humanities 
  and social sciences who are enthusiastic about computational methods!."
