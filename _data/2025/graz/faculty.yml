  bio: |
    <p>The Complex Social & Computational Systems Group conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of technology, social dynamics, and policy to address challenges in online discourse and societal cohesion. Combining computational methods with social science, their work informs ethical platform design, counters misinformation, and promotes healthier digital ecosystems. Key projects include:</p>
    
    <p>Designing Social Media Recommendation Algorithms for Societal Good (ERC-funded):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Aims to redesign content recommendation algorithms to reduce systemic risks (e.g., polarization, outrage) under the EU's Digital Services Act.</li>
    <li>Integrates social science frameworks with computational models to prioritize societal well-being over engagement metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Spread of Conspiracy Theories in Online Spaces (FWF/netidee-funded):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Analyzes German-language Telegram data (23TB from the "Schwurbelarchiv") to disentangle individual, social, and technological drivers of conspiracy theory dissemination.</li>
    <li>Focuses on platform-level interventions (e.g., curbing coordinated actors) rather than stigmatizing users.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Fracturing of Honesty in Political Communication:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Traces the rise of "belief-speaking" (subjective, evidence-free claims) vs. "truth-seeking" (evidence-based discourse) in U.S. politicians' tweets (2011–2022).</li>
    <li>Reveals Republicans' shift toward belief-speaking correlates with sharing low-quality news sources, exacerbating misinformation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Effectiveness of Counterspeech Strategies:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Collaborates with social scientists to identify effective tactics (e.g., humor, questioning) against organized hate groups (e.g., Reconquista Germanica).</li>
    <li>Uses machine learning to classify strategies and measure de-escalation outcomes in German Twitter data.</li>
    </ul>

  bio: "Tim Booker explores the societal implications of social media, with a focus on how recommender systems influence beliefs, communication, and culture within Western liberal democracies. His doctoral thesis designs and evaluates alternative recommender systems that prioritise healthier civic discourse over typical engagement metrics."

  bio: "Elisabeth Höldrich is a PhD candidate at the IDea_Lab since 2024, researching the rise and spread of conspiracy theories in online environments within the Orientation in Conspiration project (ORION). Through the application of Natural Language Processing and topic modeling Elisabeth hopes to measure different characteristics of individual conspiracy theories and identify which of these characteristics contribute most to the popularity of a conspiracy theory."

  bio: "Mathias is researching dynamics in collective adaptation. To this end, opinions are modeled as networks, whereby topics that are often expressed in similar contexts are particularly close to each other. These opinion networks can be very characteristic for individual people and also aggregated for groups. Changes in these networks due to new group constellations can provide indications of the extent to which people are influenced in their decisions by their social environment. In addition to agent-based modeling approaches, data from social networks is used to depict such opinion networks and look at their patterns of change."
