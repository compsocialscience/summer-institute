  bio: "Lingfei Wu is an Assistant Professor of Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh. His research leverages big data, complexity science, and AI to advance the Science of Team Science and Innovation. He has transformed prior research in two key ways: first, by introducing the Disruption Index (D-index) as the first metric for scientific breakthroughs, shifting research evaluation from citation-based popularity to disruptive innovation; and second, by uncovering the hidden costs of team collaboration—how large teams can suppress individual creativity and recognition, thus complementing organizational studies that focus mainly on team benefits. His work provides the scientific foundation for funding innovative small teams, as well as informing organizational and policy changes to balance individual and team success in the age of team-based science. 
  Lingfei’s research is widely recognized in Computational Social Science and the Science of Science, with publications in <i>Nature, PNAS</i>, and other top journals. His work has been featured in major media outlets, including <i>The New York Times, Harvard Business Review, Forbes, The Atlantic, and Scientific American</i>. As a thought leader in research evaluation, he has advised organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Novo Nordisk Foundation, and John Templeton Foundation. His research and teaching excellence have been recognized with awards including the NSF CAREER Award, Richard King Mellon Award, and Oxford Martin Fellowship." # add speaker bio here
