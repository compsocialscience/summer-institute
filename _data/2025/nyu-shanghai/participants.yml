She holds a master's degree in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) from Columbia University. Her research focuses on labor market inequality, particularly at the intersection of race, gender, and class in the U.S. high-skilled workforce. Her MA thesis at Columbia University used data from the Minority Corporate Counsel Association (MCCA) to examine systemic discrimination in the U.S. legal profession and to evaluate the impact of existing diversity initiatives. Drawing on this work, she continues to explore how informal hiring mechanisms—such as employee referrals and social networks—can reproduce inequality, even under formal diversity efforts. Xiwen integrates computational methods, including natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis, and audit designs, into her broader mixed-methods research. She has also contributed to projects involving the United Nations, where she used NLP to evaluate whether development reports reflected marginalized voices. As someone who transitioned from a humanities and social science background into computational social science, Xiwen is committed to supporting underrepresented students, especially women, in building technical skills for academic and professional advancement. After completing her Ph.D., she hopes to continue researching inequality as a professor, research scientist, and social advocate."
