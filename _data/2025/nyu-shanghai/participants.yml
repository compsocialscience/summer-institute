  bio: "Yuting He, a PhD student from the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. She is also a graduate research assistant working at the Center for Media Engagement. Yuting's research specializes in three domains: (1) Language and politics, focusing on the impact of problematic information on politics. Her work in this area includes research on political disinformation consumption behavior, and the computational development of one of the first language classifiers solving the grey zone of divisive political language. (2) Journalism studies, particularly focusing on the precarious conditions of journalistic work, such as female celebrity journalists on social media, and U.S. student journalists covering protests. (3) News production via emerging technologies, such as research on AI-generated news summaries and AI-generated election campaign videos. Methodologically, Yuting uses computationally driven mixed methods to answer her research inquiries and further broaden her research imagination within these three domains."
