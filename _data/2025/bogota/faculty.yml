  bio: "<p align='justify'>Jaime Eduardo Cuellar Cuellar, Anthropologist with a Master's degree in Economics and Public Policy from the Universidad del Rosario. My expertise is focused on the analysis of social phenomena based on digital and mixed methods, especially in technological or technoscientific phenomena that are little studied such as biases in artificial intelligence technologies such as LLM. I use programming languages such as Python to extract, analyse and visualise data with natural language processing and artificial intelligence technologies to analyse social phenomena such as migration or violence against women politicians. I have worked for institutions such as UN Women, Fair Work and the Danish Refugee Council. I am currently the head of the Communication and Digital Humanities axis of the Social Communication programme and I am part of the Digital Humanities Lab at PUJ.</p>"

  bio: "<p align='justify'>Isabella Jaimes Rodríguez is a researcher in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human-Computer Collaboration (CSCW). Her work explores how technology shapes relationships in Latino migrant communities, with a focus on domestic labour and digital platforms. She is currently a research assistant at York University and the STREET Lab at the University of Toronto. She has worked on projects on labour conditions in platform economies in contexts of informality in Colombia and Canada, using feminist technoscience theoretical frameworks to analyse the interaction between technology and society.  She has expertise in computational methods applied to social science, including network analysis, natural language processing and digital discourse analysis. She has worked with data from social networks and digital platforms to study political violence against women, digital labour, healthy habits of young people and practices in migrant communities. She has also taught data analysis courses at the Javeriana University, designed for students of organisational communication and data science, with the aim of integrating computational tools into the study of social and organisational phenomena from a critical perspective and with an emphasis on the intersection between inequality, technology and work.</p>"

  bio: "<p align='justify'>Sergio Sánchez, Sociologist with a Master's degree in Economics of Public Policy from the University of Rosario. I have a solid background in Research and Social Appropriation of Knowledge, developed at IDCBIS. My academic focus is complemented by technical skills in data analysis, including natural language processing in Python and data visualization in Power BI. In addition, I am experienced in web scraping techniques, which allow me to obtain and analyse relevant information from a variety of sources.  My passion for data science drives me to explore how analytical methodologies can transform social research and policy making. I am committed to applying advanced analytical tools to unravel patterns and provide valuable insights that support informed social and economic decision-making. I am excited about the opportunity to share my research and perspectives in this diploma course.</p>"
