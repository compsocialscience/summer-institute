  bio: "<p align='justify'>Janna Joceli Omena is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Digital Methods at the Department of Digital Humanities, King’s College London. As a digital methodologist and interdisciplinary scholar, her research centres on the epistemological aspects of AI, web technologies, digital objects, and research software; she is particularly interested in their influence on method design, implementation, and knowledge production. Her research focuses on the practice and theory of digital methods, examining computational media from conceptual, technical, and empirical perspectives to develop reproducible methodologies and research software. From 2016 to 2023, Janna spearheaded the  SMART Data Sprint at NOVA University Lisbon, a pioneering initiative in Portugal that offered a platform for teaching and developing digital methods research. She authored Métodos Digitais: Teoria-Prática-Crítica (2019), the first edited collection on digital methods in Portuguese, and co-organised a bilingual special issue on the data sprint approach (2022), published in both Spanish and English. She is a member of the Public Data Lab and the Interest Group on Knowledge Graphs at The Alan Turing Institute and collaborates with the Digital Methods Initiative.
