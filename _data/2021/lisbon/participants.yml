  bio: "Anika Kamilla Clausen is a Danish PhD student working at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland in the Business Communication department under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Laura Illia since February 2020. In 2019, she graduated from the University of Lausanne with a Master of Arts in English and German. Her PhD will focus on Open Access as a business model. The goal of my PhD is to better understand the model in different domains, i.e., academic journal publishing, open AI agents, and data sharing (social media data). The aim is to develop a project that includes a theoretical understanding of the concept, and a practical aspect. The practical part of her thesis will hopefully be to develop a social media lab that makes it possible to share large amounts of data with other researchers."
