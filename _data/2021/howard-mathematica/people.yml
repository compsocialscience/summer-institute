Currently, she is collaborating with an interdisciplinary team to develop a phone application to understand housing needs among precariously housed and homeless Veterans. She is also working with faculty and students at UC Irvine, through the PrisonPandemic Project, to document and disseminate stories from incarcerated people in CA about living through COVID-19. Her work is published in journals including American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Criminology, Demography, Social Forces, Social Problems, and Sociological Methods and Research, and has been supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Justice, and National Science Foundation.
