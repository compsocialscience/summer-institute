# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty who are interested in computational social science. While there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment, applicants are expected to be able to attend the event psychically in Beijing. About 25 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete the SICSS boot camp.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Applicants must submit the following documents: 
1) A letter of application (no more than 500 words) that summarizes your research interests, your achievements, and potential contributions to the event (in English)
2) A publication or writing sample that best represents your research around computational social science (either in English or Chinese)
3) Your CV (either in English or Chinese)

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 11:59 pm on ~~May 1, 2023~~ May 7, 2023 (Beijing time).** All application materials must be submitted through [Google Form](https://forms.gle/8bSefiV5DWZmpaYv6) or [Wenjuanxing Form](https://www.wjx.top/vm/rxJeYPC.aspx#).

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Beijing, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Beijing if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
