# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation targets people interested in research, ideally graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within seven years of their Ph.D. That said, we may accept applications from undergraduate students who are concluding their degrees and intend to pursue a postgraduate program in a related field. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together people interested in computational social science across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience (i.e., coding, stats) will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during three weeks before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must (i) submit their curriculum vitae and (ii) fill out a form describing their research topics and interest in computational social science. In addition, we encourage participants to share an optional writing sample. 

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by Monday, May 22, 2023 at 11:59 CLT**.  All application materials must be submitted through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfylTVk_vJDevsuhfvBkA1IQGJwhDgDBeFGT49fjS_I1hIdxA/viewform)

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Chile, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.


#### Can I participate in SICSS-Chile if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
