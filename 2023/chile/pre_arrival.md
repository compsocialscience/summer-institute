# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-Chile 2023.

- Complete the pre-institute readings.
- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed).
- Prepare your computing environment. Participants are expected to bring their computers.

## Reading

In order to prepare for SICSS-Chile 2023, we recommend reading Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196107/bit-by-bit)), or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.

[SICSS curriculum](https://sicss.io/curriculum), part of the content of the book is covered in the SICSS curriculum videos and code. 

## Coding Boot Camp

The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.

If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- [Python Data Science Handbook
](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), Taught by Jake VanderPlas at University of Washington. This book includes tutorials, coding (notebooks), and assignments.
- [Real Python - Data science tutorials](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/), a website that provides several resources using Python for multiple tasks used for data analysis.
- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
- [Introduction to Computational Social Science with Python](https://github.com/gesis-css-python/materials), Dr. Milena Tsvetkova and Dr. Milena Tsvetkova and Dr. Patrick Gildersleve from GESIS prepared this resourceful set of materials with Computational Social Science references and exercises with Python libraries. 

Additionally, we provided online materials from our research partners CENIA and IMFD (both are mainly in Spanish):

- [IMFD Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FundamentosdelosDatos), a Youtube account that contains several talks, keynotes and tutorials about practical and theorical topics in data management.
- [OpenCenia](https://cenia.cl/opencenia/), a website with several online resources, such as courses, datasets and AI models.


Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-Chile will employ Python. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as R, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support those languages.


## Computing environment

*Participants are expected to bring their computers to the sessions.* 


### Python

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support Python. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). We also suggest online environment tools such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to code and compile your notebooks.

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-Chile 2023, you should have an account in the SICSS Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
