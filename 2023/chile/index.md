From July 17 to July 27, 2023, the Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data [(IMFD)](https://imfd.cl/), the National Center For Artificial Intelligence [(CENIA)](https://cenia.cl/), the Computer Science Department of the University of Chile, and the Institute of Sociology of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (ISUC) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at the Pontificia Universidad Católica, Campus San Joaquín. The Summer Institute aims to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, tutorials, exercises, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include:

* ethics
* digital data collection 	
* machine learning
* text as data
* image as data
* surveys in the digital age
* network science
* visualization tools 
				
There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released as open-source.

Participation targets people interested in research, ideally graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within seven years of their Ph.D. That said, we intend to accept applications from undergraduate students concluding their degrees, pursuing a postgraduate program in a related field, or having proven research experience. In addition, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to attend and fully participate in the two-week program.

[Application materials](https://sicss.io/2023/chile/apply) are due Monday, May 22, 2023 at 23:59 CLT.
