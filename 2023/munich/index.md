From July 24 to August 4, 2023, the university of Munich will host a partner site for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include collecting digital trace data, automated text analysis, transparent and reproducible research and ethics.There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. The chosen participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

Information about the due date regarding the [Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2023/munich/apply) are coming soon.
