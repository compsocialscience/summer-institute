## Vanilla topic modeling - latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)

> "Topic models are algorithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large and otherwise unstructured collection of documents. Topic models can organize the collection according to the discovered themes." (Blei 2012)

-   LDA is a mixed membership model and the name is based upon the [dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution){target="_blank"}
-   idea: texts are generated by latent topics.
-   each document is a mixture over topics. Each topic is a mixture over words
-   we have to fix the number of topics ex ante

## LDA - disadvantages

-   the initialization of LDA models is not deterministic: starting parameters are initially set to random values. This affects model stability and introduces repllication problems
-   good implementations of LDA topic models often require dependencies beyond R (e.g. java for [mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/){target="_blank"})
-   LDA is "blind" to context information. It only models term co-occurence without considering meta data

## Introducing the Structural Topic Model (STM)

-   text documents often include contextual information, e.g. time stamps or author attributes

-   a huge variety of social science questions is motivated by connecting metadata with textual data

-   STM provides two ways to include contextual information:

    -   Topic prevelance can vary by metadata (e.g. Democrats talk more about education than Republicans)
    -   Topic content can vary by metadata (e.g. Democrats are less likely to use the word life when talking about abortion than Republicans)

-   you can find many publications and auxiliary packages for STM on [structuraltopicmodel.com](structuraltopicmodel.com){target="_blank"}

## STM - R Package

-   structural topic models can be estimated and interpreted with the R package `stm`

-   the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf){target="_blank"} introduces the functionality of the package and is worth a read

-   package advantages:

    -   very comprehensive documentation
    -   good starting values for hyperparameters
    -   extensive functionality for validating and visualising models

-   disadvantages: base R approach (no `ggplot2` graphics, no `tidy` data structures -\> we will fix that with [stminsights](https://cschwem2er.github.io/stminsights/){target="_blank"})

## Reload our DonorsChoose data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(stm)
library(stminsights)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
load('data/dfm_donor.Rdata')
dim(dfm_donor)
```

## Prepare textual data for STM

You can provide input data for the stm package in several ways:

-   via STM's own functions for text pre-processing
-   via directly passing quanteda dfm's
-   using quanteda's `convert()` function to prepare dfm's (recommended option)

```{r}
out <- convert(dfm_donor, to = 'stm')
names(out)
```

## STM - model fitting

For our first model, we will choose 30 topics and include school metro type (urban vs rural), teacher gender and a flexible [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)%7Btarget=%22_blank%22%7D) for date as prevalence covariates:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stm_30 <- stm(documents = out$documents, 
      vocab = out$vocab,
      data = out$meta,
      K = 30, 
      prevalence = ~ school_metro_type + gender + s(date_num),
      verbose = TRUE) # show progress

stm_effects30 <- estimateEffect(1:30 ~ school_metro_type + 
      gender + s(date_num),
      stmobj = stm_30, metadata = out$meta)
```

## Saving and restoring models

-   depending on the number of documents and the vocabulary size, fitting STM models can require a lot of memory and computation time
-   it can be useful to save model objects as R binaries and reload them as needed:

```{r, eval = FALSE }
save(out, stm_30, stm_effects30, 
     file = "data/stm_donor.RData")
```

```{r}
load("data/stm_donor.RData") # reload data
```

## Model interpretation - topic proportions

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'summary', text.cex = 0.8)
```

## Model interpretation - probability terms

`label` plots show terms for each topic with (again) the most likely terms as a default:

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'labels', n = 8, 
         text.cex = 0.8, width = 100, topics = 1:5)
```

## Model interpretation - frex terms

One strength of STM is that it also offers other metrics for topic terms. `frex` terms are both frequent and exclusive to a topic.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'labels', n = 8, text.cex = 0.8, 
         width = 100, topics = 1:5, labeltype = 'frex')
```

## Model interpretation - don't rely on terms only

-   assigning labels for topics only by looking at the most likely terms is generally not a good idea

-   sometimes these terms contain domain-specific stop words. Sometimes they are hard to make sense of by themselves

-   recommendation:

    -   use probability (most likely) terms
    -   use frex terms
    -   **qualitatively examine representative documents**

## Model interpretation - representative documents

STM allows to find representative (unprocessed) documents for each topic with `findThoughts()`, which can then be plotted with `plotQuote()`:

```{r}
thoughts <- findThoughts(stm_30, 
     texts = out$meta$text, # unprocessed documents
     topics = c(1,4),  n = 2) # topics and number of documents
```

## Model interpretation - representative documents

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
cat(thoughts$docs$`Topic 4`[1]) # topic 4 doc 1
```

## Interactive model validation - stminsights

You can interactively validate and explore structural topic models using the R package *stminsights*. What you need:

-   one or several stm models and corresponding effect estimates
-   the `out` object used to fit the models
-   the example `stm_donor.RData` includes all required objects

```{r eval=FALSE}
run_stminsights()
```

For more details see the [stminsights website](https://cschwem2er.github.io/stminsights){target="_blank"}

## Interpreting and visualizing prevalence and content effects

-   we already estimated prevalence effects. Now we'll see how to also estimate content effects and how to visualize effects

-   there are several options for interpreting and visualizing effects:

    -   using functions of the STM package
    -   using stminsights function `get_effects()`
    -   usting stminsights interactive mode

## Prevalence effects (stm package)

-   prevalence covariates affect topic proportions

-   they can be visualized in three ways:

    -   `pointestimate`: pointestimates for categorical variables
    -   `difference`: differences between topic proportions for two categories of one variable
    -   `continuous`: line plots for continuous variables

-   you can also visualize interaction effects if you integrated them in your STM model (see `?plot.estimateEffect()`)

## Prevalence effects - pointestimate

```{r }
plot.estimateEffect(stm_effects30, topic = 3, 
            covariate = 'school_metro_type', method = 'pointestimate')
```

## Prevalence effects - continuous

```{r }
plot.estimateEffect(stm_effects30, covariate = "date_num", 
                    topics = c(9:10), method = "continuous")
```

## Prevalence effects with stminsights

You can use `get_effects()` to store prevalence effects in a tidy data frame:

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
effects <- get_effects(estimates = stm_effects30, 
                      variable = 'gender',
                      type = 'pointestimate')
```

Afterwards, effects can for instance be visualized with `ggplot2`

## Prevalence effects with stminsights

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
effects |> filter(topic == 3 & value %in% c('Female', 'Male')) |>
ggplot(aes(x = value, y = proportion)) + geom_point(size = 2.5) +
 geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.1) +
 coord_flip() + labs(x = 'Gender', y = 'Topic Proportion')
```

## STM content effects

-   content effects allow covariates to affect word distributions **within a topic** (e.g. female teachers talk differently about sports in comparison to male teachers). Example model formula: `content = ~ gender`

-   this feature is powerful but comes with some disadvantages:

    -   you can only use one discrete variable for content effects
    -   interpreting the model is more complicated (see \`labelTopics() and sageLabels()
    -   we will focus on visualizing content effects with `perspective` plots

## Fitting content models

-   content models can (but do not have to) be combined with prevalence models. We fit a model with 20 topics and teacher gender as content covariate
-   important note: this as a new model and can show different results, even if you compare it to a model with the same number of topics

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stm_20_content <- stm(documents = out$documents, 
      vocab = out$vocab,
      data = out$meta,
      K = 20, 
      prevalence = ~ school_metro_type + gender + s(date_num),
      content = ~ gender,
      verbose = FALSE) # show progress
stm_effects20 <- estimateEffect(1:20 ~ school_metro_type + 
      gender + s(date_num),
      stmobj = stm_20_content, metadata = out$meta)
save(stm_20_content, stm_effects20,file =  "data/stm_donor_content.RData")
```

## Load content model

```{r}
load("data/stm_donor_content.RData") # reload data
```

## Visalizing content effects

```{r fig.height=6.5, fig.width=7.5}
plot.STM(stm_20_content, topics = c(2), type = 'perspectives', 
         covarlevels = c('Female', 'Male'))
```
