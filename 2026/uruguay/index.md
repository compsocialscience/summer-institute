In **2026** (date TBD), the [Methods and Data Access Unit (UMAD)](https://umad.cienciassociales.edu.uy/) at the [Faculty of Social Sciences](https://cienciassociales.edu.uy/), University of the Republic (Uruguay), will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. 

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty interested in computational social science. The Institute is open to both social scientists and data scientists (broadly conceived). It will be conducted entirely in Spanish, and no funding for travel or lodging is provided.

The instructional program will include lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be invited speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, including academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, web scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics.

Participants will have ample opportunities to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, fellow participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and participants for the Summer Institute will be released as open-source resources.

Participation is restricted to Master’s students, PhD students, and professionals in the Social Sciences (Sociology, Political Science, Communication, Humanities, or related fields) who wish to deepen their knowledge of computational methods and tools for the analysis of social data. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially those from groups currently underrepresented in computational social science. Approximately 15 participants will be invited, and selected participants are expected to attend and actively participate in the full two-week program.
