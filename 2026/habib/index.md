From June 8 to June 19, 2026, [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/) will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS-Habib) in Karachi, Pakistan. This institute, the first of its kind hosted in Pakistan, is designed to build capacity in computational social science by equipping researchers with the tools and frameworks needed to apply data-driven approaches to multidisciplinary challenges. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together senior undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in exploring computational social science methods within their areas of interest. 

The instructional program will include lectures by invited guest speakers, workshops led by faculty, and participant-led research projects. Participants will engage in tutorials covering core methods such as extracting digital trace data, quantitative text analysis, network analysis, and statistical analysis revolving around key themes such as causal inference, digital polarization, civic discourse, and the societal impacts of technology, with a specific focus on the Global South. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty, and exceptional undergraduate students with backgrounds in computer science, engineering, social sciences, and related fields. We expect to invite approximately 20-25 participants. SICSS-Habib is deeply committed to diversity and accessibility; to address regional gender disparities, 50% of all funded seats are reserved for female participants. Participants are expected to attend the full two-week program in person at the Habib University campus. 

Application materials are due on {date not yet determined}.
