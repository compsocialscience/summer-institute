# Apply

Please use this form to apply to the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS Istanbul 2026), which will take place from **July 6 to July 18, 2026**, at **Özyeğin University**, Istanbul.

## Program Format

SICSS Istanbul 2026 will be held as a **residential, full-time retreat** on the Özyeğin University campus. Participants will be housed in university dormitories for the duration of the program (see accommodation information [here](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en/dormitories)).

Because the Institute runs full-day activities involving group work, instruction, and collaborative research, **full in-person participation is mandatory**. The program is **not compatible with remote or part-time attendance**. Applicants who are unable to commit full-time to the residential format in Istanbul are encouraged to apply to another SICSS location.

## Eligibility and Admissions

Admission priority is given to **PhD students and postdoctoral researchers** whose work focuses on the social implications of digital human footprint data and artificial intelligence, broadly defined.

On rare occasions, applications from **exceptional master’s students** and **early-career assistant professors** with a demonstrated commitment to computational social science may also be considered.

Applications are welcome from all countries and institutions. Approximately **20 participants** will be selected.

## Program Expectations

The Institute brings together computational social scientists across a wide range of disciplinary and technical backgrounds. Participants with limited experience in social science research may be expected to complete additional preparatory readings. Participants with less experience in coding will be expected to complete the SICSS Boot Camp.

Preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant, who will offer online office hours during the two months preceding the Institute.

## Evaluation Criteria

Applicants are evaluated holistically, with attention to alignment between their research trajectory and the theory, empirics, and methods of computational social science. Evaluation criteria include:

- research and/or teaching contributions to computational social science,
- contributions to public goods (e.g., open-source software, curated datasets, educational resources),
- likelihood of benefiting from participation,
- likelihood of contributing to peer learning, and
- ability and willingness to participate in an Institute-run research cluster and co-author a collaborative project.

Preference is given to applicants who have **not previously attended a SICSS site**.

## Application Materials

Applicants must submit the following materials through the application form: **[HERE](http://forms.gle/yqHAyGZwb7ExmHKm9)**

- a current curriculum vitae (CV),
- a sample research project (e.g., research proposal, published article, or working paper),
- a motivation letter (maximum two pages) describing research interests, how SICSS Istanbul connects to the applicant’s thesis or broader research trajectory, and which member of the organizing team the applicant hopes to be mentored by and potentially co-author with.

Applicants must also explicitly confirm in their motivation letter that they are able to attend the Institute **full-time and in person** for the entire duration of the residential program.

In addition, **one letter of recommendation** must be sent directly by the recommender to:  
[sicss_istanbul@ozyegin.edu.tr](mailto:sicss_istanbul@ozyegin.edu.tr)

## Deadlines and Notification

To receive full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by **March 2, 2026**, through the application form.

Incomplete applications may not be reviewed. Decisions will be communicated by email in **early April 2026**, and selected participants will be asked to confirm their participation shortly thereafter.

## Contact

Questions regarding the application process may be directed to the main organizer, **Prof. Akın Ünver**, at  
[sicss_istanbul@ozyegin.edu.tr](mailto:sicss_istanbul@ozyegin.edu.tr).
