The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) Istanbul will return in 2026, continuing its role as a regional hub for advanced training in computational approaches to social science research.

SICSS Istanbul 2026 will be organized by Özyeğin University and co-supported by Sabancı University, Koç University, and Boğaziçi University. The Istanbul site forms part of the global SICSS network, which aims to expand access to cutting-edge computational social science training while fostering interdisciplinary and international research communities.

The purpose of SICSS Istanbul is to bring together PhD students and postdoctoral researchers who work at the intersection of social sciences, digital human footprint data, artificial intelligence, and the social implications of computational methods. The institute is designed for participants from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to sociology, political science, economics, communication studies, and related fields, as well as data science and computational research more broadly. Participants are expected to have a strong interest in applying computational methods to substantive social science questions.

The instructional program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaborative research. Participants will engage in lectures and participant-led research projects, while also benefiting from interactions with invited speakers working in different research environments. Core topics covered during the institute include text analysis, network analysis, causal inference with observational data, survey experiments, and machine learning. In line with the broader SICSS mission, particular attention is given to methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility in computational social science research.

The program will take place in two phases. The first phase is an online Pre-SICSS Bootcamp, held between June 22 and June 30, 2026. This phase is designed to provide participants with a shared methodological and technical foundation, including exposure to relevant programming tools, data structures, and key readings. The second phase is the residential SICSS retreat, which will be held between July 6 and July 17, 2026. During this phase, participants will take part in intensive in-person instruction and collaborative research activities.

Participation is restricted to PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. Approximately 25 to 30 participants will be selected through a competitive application process. Participants are expected to attend and fully participate in both phases of the program.

Applications are submitted via an online form available at:
