# Apply

## Eligibility

We do not have specific eligibility criteria for participants: there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.
About 20-30 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience.
Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute.
Participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language.
Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along several dimensions:

 1. research and teaching in computational social science
 1. contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
 1. likelihood to benefit from participation and potential for high impact research
 1. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
 1. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How to Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents:

 * Brief statement of participation, i.e., why do you wish to attend SICSS Helsinki? (max 300 words)
 * Curriculum vitae
 * Letter of intent (2-3 pages), please highlight how SICSS Helsinki can help your research activities
 * Writing example, such as a published paper or manuscript

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 19th, 4pm Helsinki time.** All application materials must be submitted through our [online system](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZOBfrpN8KPU4ZMCueIpaotBMEbqsf3ILkN1ot2h6QSTcO0g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
