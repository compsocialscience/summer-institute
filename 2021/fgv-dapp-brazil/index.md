From Monday, June 14 to Saturday, June 26, 2021, The the SICSS core sponsors  and Department of Public Policy Analysis of Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV-DAPP) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually for at the Department of Public Policy Analysis of Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV/DAPP). **The FGV-DAPP is the first-ever SICSS Edition in Brazil!**  The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). Given the expertise hosted at the FGV-DAPP, we are particularly interested in participants with interests aligned with communication, social media analysis, and public policy. 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government, and round-tables with brazilian experts on computational social science working in industry, government and social organizations. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. master students. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. To increase the diversity of the program, we expect to organize a bilingual school, with part of the local activities being organized in Portuguese. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program. 

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/apply) are due Friday, April 2, 2021.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
