__Subject:__ Mass Collaboration Activity: Fragile Families Challenge Data Files

Data files for the Fragile Families Challenge activity at SICSS 2021 are attached. These files take the information from the Office of Population Research Data Archive and provide additional helper files. Each directory contains a readme.

Once you download the zipped folder, you will need a password to open it. That password will be distributed on Slack in the "#general" channel.

You can read more about this activity in the lesson plan: https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day5-mass-collaboration/activity/lesson_plan_masscollaboration_participant.md

If you have any problems, please contact your local organizer or me via email or Slack.

We are excited to see what we all produce together in this activity!
