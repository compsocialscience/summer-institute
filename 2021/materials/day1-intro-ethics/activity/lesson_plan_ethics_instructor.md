# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2021
## Day 1, Ethics
## Prepared by Megan Kang and Matt Salganik

### Instructor preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:
- Read the [lesson plan for participants](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2021/materials/day1-intro-ethics/activity/lesson_plan_ethics_participants.md).
- Read the case study: [Case study (Hacked data)](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf)
- Think about some possible questions that you could use in the discussion, in addition to the questions assigned in the activity.

Here some possibilities:

Question 1) Does the illegal nature of the data collection and the release of private data taint the data in the release that was already publicly available?

Possible follow-ups to question 1:
- What if the data breach was accidental rather than a hack?
- What if the data hack was intentionally done by a competitor to Patreon with the goal of putting them out of business?
- What if the data release was intentional by Patreon even if it violates users' expectations?  For example, the release of the AOL search log data: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html (see also: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/technology/23search.html)
- What kind of precedent would this set? Would other researchers then hack data and release it anonymously?
- How can you ensure the accuracy of the data?

Question 2) Users of Patreon initially had an expectation of privacy, but that privacy no longer exists. Do researchers need to respect the intent or the reality?

Possible follow-up questions:
- What if these were electronic medical records?  Would that be different?

Question 3) Scholars and journalists share some functions in dealing with information and making it accessible to the public, but are the ethical considerations the same? If not, why not?

Possible follow-up questions:
- Journalists are often supervised by editors. Would it make the project more ethically permissible if these researchers had some third-party ethical review from an organization like an IRB?
- Journalists doing investigative reporting often work to expose wrong-doing. Some academic research is like that and some is not. Does it matter about the specific nature of the research?

Question 4) Researchers will nearly always claim that their research will have a net public benefit and thus their methods are justified. Who gets to decide if that is accurate in any given case?

Possible follow-up questions:
- If they used the data and you were reviewing the paper for a journal, would you accept it?
- If you were going to use the data, how would you describe it in an ethical appendix?
- Here's a case where researchers used diplomatic cables that were released by Private Manning to WikiLeaks: https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpv005. How are these cases similar or different? What do you think about the decision of these researchers?

Question 5) Would you personally use these data?

Possible follow-up questions:
- Have you ever faced a choice like this?  How did you decide?
- Many of the questions above could be used here as well.

### Group information

There is no specific guidance about how the groups should be formed; purely random should work well for this activity.

We would recommend trying this with groups of between 3 and 5 people.

### Notes

- Try to encourage participants to use the topics covered in SICSS (e.g., respect for persons, beneficence, justice, respect for law and public interest) in their discussion.
