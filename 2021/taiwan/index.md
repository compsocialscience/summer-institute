From Monday, June 28 to Friday, July 2, 2021, the Russel Sage Foundation and the the International College of Innovation (ICI) of National Chengchi University will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually at the National Chengchi University in Taiwan. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). In this partner location, we expect participants to be comfortable with understanding reading materials and lecture videos in English and with discussing content with other attendees with both English and Mandarin Chinese. 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
Participation is restricted to master students, doctoral students, post-doctoral researchers, research fellows and junior faculty.  Graduate students and researchers who are affiliated with the National Chengchi University or based in Taiwan are encouraged to apply. Participants should be comfortable with using both English and Mandarin Chinese. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 24 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

Application materials will be available on February 1st, 2021.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
