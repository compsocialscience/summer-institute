### Eligibility
### <a name="eligibility"></a>
---

We will be inviting applications from PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their PhD. Exceptional Master's students in a research-track degree (e.g. MRes, MPhil) or those transitioning to a PhD programme will also be considered. We are hoping to have wide participation from researchers across different departments and institutes within the University of Oxford, both from the social sciences and STEM areas. We would also like to welcome participants from other institutions both in the UK and abroad. The Summer Institute will be held in English. We expect to invite about 25 participants for this partner location in Oxford. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.

Participants are expected to attend both weeks of the institute. There are no registration fees to attend the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We will evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research interests, ideas, and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. We will attempt to account for an applicant's career stage and previous educational opportunities when evaluating applications.

1. First Name:
2. Last Name: 
3. Email Address:
4. Discipline of (expected) PhD degree: 
5. Current University/College:

Please note that letters of recommendation are not required for application to SICSS-Oxford and any letters, if submitted, will not be considered when evaluating applications. This is to guarantee similar consideration of all applications.

##### 1.  Can bachelor students also apply? Can full professors also apply?

No, unfortunately applying is only possible for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their PhD.

##### 2.  Can I also submit a writing sample written in a language other than English?

This is unfortunately not possible.

##### 3.  I'm a Masters student: can I apply?

We will consider applications from master's students in a research track (e.g. MPhil, MRes degrees), or MSc students transitioning to a PhD degree who have demonstrated interest and commitment to research in the area of computational social science.
