From June 9 to June 19, 2025 the Institute for Analytical Sociology will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held on the Norrköping Campus of Linköping University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings. Topics covered include the collection of digital trace data, text analysis, machine learning, social network analysis, the analysis of geospatial data, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D.). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study. About 20 to 25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. [Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2025/ias/apply) are due on March 31st, 2025.

The Summer Institute is sponsored by the Swedish Interdisciplinary Research School in Computational Social Science (SIRCSS).  SIRCSS provides courses, seminars, and networking opportunities for Ph.D. students interested in CSS.  Students interested in participating in the full, two-year cycle of Research School events should instead apply through the [SIRCSS webpage](https://liu.se/en/research/research-school-in-computational-social-science).  The deadline is also March 31st, 2025.
