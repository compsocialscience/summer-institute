## Eligibility

We invite applicants from Ph.D. students students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. who are able to attend the program in Norrköping, Sweden. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Lodging expenses for all participants will be paid for by SICSS-IAS, and limited funds are available to cover the costs of travel.  About 20 to 25 participants will be invited.  

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp.

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Applicants must submit the following documents: 1) a completed application form, 2) a curriculum vitae, and 3) a statement (maximum two pages double-spaced) describing: 

- Your current research

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 31st, 2025.** All application materials must be submitted through the [application form](https://forms.office.com/e/BTUfKCM2sa). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail within approximantely two weeks, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

The Summer Institute is sponsored by the Swedish Interdisciplinary Research School in Computational Social Science (SIRCSS). SIRCSS provides courses, seminars, and networking opportunities for Ph.D. students interested in CSS. Students interested in participating in the full, two-year cycle of Research School events should instead apply through the [SIRCSS webpage](https://liu.se/en/research/research-school-in-computational-social-science). The deadline is also March 31st, 2025.

Inquiries about SICSS-IAS or SIRCSS can be sent to sircss@liu.se.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-IAS, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-IAS if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Unfortunately, no. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
