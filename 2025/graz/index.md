## About the Program  
The internet connects people at unprecedented scales, transforming centuries-old patterns of human communication and social organisation. This restructuring has led to all new sorts of social phenomena—from global networks of gamers and K-pop fans, to the targeted manipulation of political outcomes, and international movements like the Arab Spring, the Climate Strikes, Black Lives Matter, and MeToo. The internet changes how society can evolve, for better or worse. 

Not only this, social media platforms wield unprecedented power: they control the infrastructure of public discourse, harvest intimate behavioral data, and operate with minimal transparency. Recent developments—including the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), whistleblower revelations (e.g., Meta’s internal research on mental health harms), and election interference (e.g., the recent Romanian elections)—underscore the urgency of the crisis.

What does this mean for democracy, a centuries-old system of collective governance? Social media—barely two decades old—has rapidly reshaped the social foundations that democracy rests on. Can traditional democratic systems coexist with the new social fabric, or does their growing divergence demand radical systemic redesign?

Blending political philosophy and computational data science, the program starts from the conceptual foundations of democracy (what is it, do we have it, and do we even want it?) and builds up to contemporary discussions on the interactions between social media and democracy, the ethical role of science and scientists in the digital age, and finally, new ideas for the future of governance and social media.

## Who Should Apply  
This program is for graduate students who:  
- Research in computational social science, computer science, data science, or adjacent fields.  
- Political science, philosphy, social science, with some background in programming. 
- Want to critically examine technology’s societal role—without jargon or oversimplification.

We strongly prefer applicants with a background in at least basic coding skills (Python/R/Julia).

## Schedule  

### **Week 1: Foundations**  

**Monday: Welcome Day**  
- Participants will get to know each other and the organising team.  
- Provide guidance on engaging in respectful dialogue on potentially contentious topics.  



**Tuesday: Democracy and Social Fabric from First Principles**  
- Define democracy from the ground up, free of Western-centric or romanticized assumptions.  
- Challenge the presumed superiority of traditional democratic models.  

Understand democracy as a system of collective decision-making (situated among other systems), not merely as an unjustified ideal.
Explore perspectives on what democracy is, what it does well or poorly, how it is justified in societies, and what defines a healthy versus unhealthy democracy.

**Wednesday: Social Media’s Impact on Democracy and Discourse**  
- Diagnose how social media platforms erode trust (e.g., through algorithmic radicalisation) using interdisciplinary tools.  


Investigate the ways in which social media interacts with democracy, both positively and negatively.
Examine contemporary applied efforts aimed at understanding the impacts of social media on various aspects of democracy.

**Thursday: Conceptually and Ethically Sound Data Science**  
- Learn how to audit algorithms and articulate the ethical frameworks that guide your analysis.  

Learn about the challenges of using social media data from both a conceptual standpoint (e.g., interpreting social media data soundly) and an ethical perspective (e.g., the responsibilities of science and industry when handling large social media datasets).
Explore advanced data science methods, such as building a large language model (LLM) and applying ethical considerations in its development.

**Friday: The Future of Governance & Social Media**  
- Propose innovative governance models or technologies that address root causes rather than merely treating symptoms.  

Delve into new approaches to governance and the evolving role of social media.
Observe and engage with debates among different thinkers about the direction of these ideas.

### **Week 2: Collaborative Exploration of Social Media & Democracy**  

In Week 2, students will dive into group projects to investigate urgent societal challenges at the intersection of social media and democracy. Guided by supervisors, teams will design their own project direction, blending creativity with critical analysis to tackle systemic issues—such as algorithmic bias, polarization, or democratic participation—rather than individual-level problems.  

**Key Focus**  
- Think systemically: Address root causes, not symptoms (e.g., how recommender systems shape public discourse, not individual "bad actors").  
- Embrace interdisciplinary approaches: Merge technical, philosophical, and social science perspectives.  
- Ground in reality: Use the school’s real-world datasets or societal contexts, but explore freely—projects can be conceptual, technical, or experimental.  

**Project Pathways**  
- **Social Simulation:** Build agent-based models (ABMs) or evolutionary game theory (EGT) simulations to explore dynamics like misinformation spread.  
- **Philosophical Inquiry:** Analyze ethical dilemmas (e.g., privacy vs. transparency) or epistemic risks (e.g., filter bubbles).  
- **Data-Analysis Work:** Acquire, analyse, or visualise social media data to uncover trends (e.g., polarisation metrics).  

**Guidance & Resources**  
- Supervisors will provide mentorship and access to in-house datasets (e.g., social media interaction logs, election-related data).  
- Technical support is available for simulations, data analysis, or conceptual design.  

**Expectations**  
- Quality over speed: Avoid rushed models or superficial analyses. Spend time refining ideas—conceptual work is valid and encouraged before coding.  
- No pressure to publish, but rigor is welcomed: Projects can range from thought experiments to publishable research.  
- Creativity first: Whether designing a speculative digital democracy tool or a data art piece, originality matters.  

By week’s end, groups will outline a clear vision for their project, ready to prototype, model, or analyze in subsequent weeks. Think boldly—this is your chance to reimagine the digital public sphere!
