# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-CMU 2025.

- Browse through the pre-institute readings
- Complete [coding boot camp](#coding-boot-camp) 
    - Complete by April 25th for participants with conditional acceptance, optional for others
- Prepare your computing environment

## Office Hours

-------------------------

Our TAs, [Elizabeth Cucuzzella and Vu Hoang](/2025/cmu/people/#teaching_assistants), will be hosting office hours via Slack (invitation via email) and Zoom to support you as you work through installations and the coding bootcamp. Office hours begin on March 27th (Thursday) and will take place on [Eastern Standard Time (EST)](https://time.is/ET) every: 
- 5 - 6pm on Tuesday
- 9 - 10am on Thursday
- 5 - 6pm on Thursday
- 9 - 10am on Friday 

Please check the Slack channel for any changes in office hours. If you have questions outside of office hours, please feel free to drop them in the channel and we will get back to you. 

## Recommended Readings

-------------------------

### What is computational social science (CSS)?
If computational social science is new to you, we recommend browsing Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age.](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/)* and Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's *[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)* These books are readily availble online (open access/open review version) or you can purchase them from your [favorite bookseller](https://bookshop.org/)). You can also find a [physical copy of *Bit by Bit*](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/6lpsnm/alma991019580383904436) or the [publication copy of *Data Feminism*](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/6lpsnm/alma991019886231504436) in our library.

## Coding Boot Camp

-------------------------

The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence. 

Please headover to the [boot camp page]((https://sicss.io/boot_camp)) to access the materials. It should take approximately 7 hours to go through the tutorials and exercises. We recommend pacing them out across the month. Our [TAs are available to help you](#office-hours) as you complete the materials.

### Additional Resources

If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we recommend are:
- Learn R with the [swirl package](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
- [Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) (previously RStudio Primers), which can be supplemented with _[R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)_ by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund
- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry  
- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments

Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-CMU 2025 will be done in R. You are welcome to program in a language of your choice, such as Python and Julia, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them.

## Setting up your Computing Environment

-------------------------

### R and RStudio

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 

If you have issues installing R and RStudio, please drop by our [office hours](#office-hours) and we can help get you set up.

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-CMU 2025, you should have an account in the SICSS-CMU Slack workspace. The invitation to join the workspace was sent to your email address. If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials. Please [reach out](mailto:sicss@andrew.cmu.edu) if you need help getting Slack set up.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
