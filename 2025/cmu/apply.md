## Eligibility

SICSS-CMU is designed and intended for graduate students (including masters students), postdoctoral researchers, staff, and early-career faculty who are able to attend the program in-person at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially for those who identify with having limited experiences in computational methods. About 25 participants will be invited. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment, however, we are unable to sponsor visas nor offer funds for the institute.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists, digital humanists, and data scientists across different levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science and digital humantities research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete the [SICSS boot camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp).

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) current/future research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) current/future contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous opportunities.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-CMU, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-CMU if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Unfortunately, no. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
