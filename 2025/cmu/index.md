From May 12 to May 23, 2025 [Carnegie Mellon University Libraries](https://www.library.cmu.edu/) will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held in Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, staff, and faculty interested in exploring computational methods through interdisciplinary work. The Summer Institute is for social scientists (broadly conceived), digital humanists (broadly conceived), and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science and digital humanities research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and civic data. Topics covered include text as data, network analysis, ethics, open science and data literacies. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is limited to graduate students (including masters students), postdoctoral researchers, staff, and early-career faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially for those who identify with having limited experiences in computational methods. About 25 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 10-day program. 

[Application materials](/2025/cmu/apply) are due on March 07 2025 (Friday).
