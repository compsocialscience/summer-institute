**PARTICIPATION**

From June 30 to July 11, SICSS-Lake Como brings together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. SICSS started as an initiative at Princeton University in 2017 for both social scientists and data scientists. Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, with no geographical restriction. About 20 participants are invited. The instructional program involves lectures; group problem sets and a research project. There will be ample opportunities to discuss ideas and research.


**LOCATION**

SICSS-Lake Como is hosted at Villa del Grumello, a historical building on the shores of Lake Como. Its historic park, laid out according to the romantic canon, is home of centuries-old cedars, pines, magnolias, camphor trees, fragrant oleas, sequoias, and seasonal flowers. Grumello is the heart of the Chilometro della Conoscenza (Kilometer of Knowledge): a civic network and a public park which connects the estates of Grumello, Villa Olmo and Villa Sucota / Antonio Ratti Foundation on the western lakefront of the city of Como. Grumello is a place of sharing and participation. Since 2013, it hosts the Lake Como School of Advanced Studies to promote advanced education, research, culture and university – a project by Fondazione Alessandro Volta joint with the University of Insubria, the University of Milano, the University of Milano-Bicocca, the University of Pavia, with the addition of the Polytechnic University of Milan in 2019, and supported by Fondazione Cariplo.


**COST & ACCOMMODATION**

Shared-room accommodation is provided for participants at Hotel Engadina (Viale Fratelli Rosselli, 22). This is located 10 minutes away from Villa del Grumello (Via Per Cernobbio, 11).
