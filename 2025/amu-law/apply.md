# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty fellows within 7 years of their PhD. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment, however, due to the time zones, in the case of two equally excellent applications, the preference will be given to candidates from GMT0, GMT+1, GMT+2, and GMT+3. About 30 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially graduates from law, political sciences, sociology, criminology, psychology, linguistics and data science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents (all in .doc or .pdf): 
+ a curriculum vitae,
+ a short film (up to one minunte) or a cover letter (max 2 pages) i.e., why do you wish to attend SICSS-AMU/Law, your current research interests, future plans and how these intersect with the goals of this partner location?, 
+ links to recent projects (optional) – these could include research publications, an online application developed by the applicant, or a tutorial led by the applicant.

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 31 March 2025 (GMT+2).** All application materials must be submitted through [Online application form](https://sicss.web.amu.edu.pl/).

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-AMU, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-AMU/Law if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Yes! Every year, we offer a slightly different program, and we are always happy to welcome old friends back. While we strive to give new participants a chance to join SICSS, we also appreciate the contributions of returning attendees.
