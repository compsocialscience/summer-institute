## Eligibility

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, particularly Computer Science and Social Sciences. Participants are expected to have beginner to intermediate knowledge of Python; those who don’t will be required to complete additional readings before the program. Those with less experience in social sciences are recommended to go through the reading materials provided prior to the summer school. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. 

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## Costs, Funding and Grants

The summer institute is free of charge and we will take care of lunches on the weekdays and other scheduled events.

However, we do not offer other scholarships or free travel/accommodation for participants.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Saarbrücken, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot simultaneously have multiple applications under review.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Saarbrücken if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Unfortunately, no. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
