From November 22 to November 28, 2025 the [Emerging Scholars Network (ESN)](https://iamcr.org/s-wg/section/esn) will host the Autumn Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held online. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, with a special emphasis on computational communication science. There will also be visiting speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 2 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially neighboring institutions in the Middle East and the wider Global South. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.
Application materials are due on **Friday, October 31, 2025, at 12:00 noon (Gulf Standard Time)**.
