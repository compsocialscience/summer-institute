## Eligibility

We invite applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D., who are able to attend the program in-person at Stanford University. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, particularly those interested in studying online platforms, such as social media or search engines. About 25-30 participants will be invited and there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. 

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience in social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete the [SICSS boot camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp).

We will evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 
1) research, teaching, and other activities in the area of computational social science 
2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 
3) likelihood to benefit from participation 
4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 
5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research 

Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: 1) a curriculum vitae, 2) a statement of interest (maximum two pages double-spaced) describing: 

- Your current research and how it relates to computational social science
- Why you want to participate in SICSS-Stanford
- How participation will aid your future research
- Your experience and/or interest in collaborative research (carrying out a collaborative research project is a core component of SICSS-Stanford)
- A possible topic, method, or question you would like to focus on for a collaborative project

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by May 2, 2025.** All application materials must be submitted through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/cS3H1t8PuP9qJnKR9). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by May 23, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to ronalder@stanford.edu

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Stanford, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Stanford if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Unfortunately, no. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
