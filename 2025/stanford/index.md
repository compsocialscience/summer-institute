From August 4 to August 15, 2025 the Stanford Cyber Policy Center and Social Media Lab will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science to be held at Stanford University (SICSS-Stanford). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group activities, guest speakers, and participant-led research projects, with a special emphasis on approaches to studying online platforms, such as social media or search engines, and how people interact with those platforms. Our guest speakers will include computational social scientists from a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government, as well as policy experts who will help bridge the gap between computational social science research and policy. Topics covered include data collection and research design, text and network analysis, machine learning and AI, and privacy and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially those from neighboring institutions near Stanford, California, and those with limited experience in computational methods. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 10-day program, but we are open to alternative arrangements for faculty members. 

[Application materials](https://sicss.io/2025/stanford/apply) are due on May 2, 2025.
