# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-Stanford 2025.

- Complete the pre-read
- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed)
- Watch lecture videos
- Prepare your computing environment

Organizers will be available via Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials. Please feel free to reach out to us!

## Reading

In order to prepare for SICSS-Stanford 2025, we recommend you read Matt Salganikâ€™s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics. You might also consider reading the introduction of the book *[Network Science](https://networksciencebook.com/)* for an overview of this field, as we will use tools and ideas from network science at SICSS-Stanford. 

## Coding Boot Camp

Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-Stanford 2025 will employ Python. We recommend the participants have working knowledge and experience with python programming. If you would like more practice, some materials we recommend are:

* [Codecademy](https://try.codecademy.com/learn-python-3)
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/tutorials/basics/)
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), taught by Jake VanderPlas at University of Washington. This book includes tutorials, coding (notebooks), and assignments.
* [Data Carpentry - Python] https://datacarpentry.org/python-socialsci/
* Software carpentry Unix Shell: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>
* Software carpentry Python: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>
* Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python by Melanie Walsh: <https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html>
* Book: *Doing Computational Social Science: A Practical Introduction*, J. McLevey
* Course: EdX Python for research: <https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research#!>
- [Introduction to Python from sololearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-introduction).

You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as R, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used, however, we cannot support all these languages.

The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.

If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.



<!-- Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-Stanford 2025 will employ R. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support each of these languages. -->

## Computing environment


### Python

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support Python. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of the [Python software](https://www.python.org/) and a Python interpreter such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), or have your Google account ready to use with [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).



### R

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-Stanford 2025, you should have an account in the SICSS Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
