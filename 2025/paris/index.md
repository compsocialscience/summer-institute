From June 23rd to July 3rd, 2025 the Institut Polytechnique de Paris will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. It will take place at ENSAE, in Palaiseau, France. This has been made possible by the generous support of SICSS, the Templeton Fondation, CREST, and Hi!Paris. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together scholars interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The Summer Institute is open to social scientists, computer scientists, and a few seats could be reserved for people working professionally at this intersection (such as data journalists) if applicable. **Please note that although the first 5 days of SICSS-Paris 2025 will be held onsite, the 4 remaining days will be held remotely. This is to facilitate group work, and to foster inclusivity.** The institute will involve lectures in the morning, lab sessions in the afternoon, and about 6 evening guest lectures. During the second week, the participants will take part in group work aimed at advancing a research project and attend remote guest lectures as well.

**This year’s institute will focus on Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence.** Sessions will take students all the way from an introduction to text analysis through to practical uses of and critical perspectives on deep learning for text analysis in the social sciences. Participants will have ample opportunities to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, with other participants, as well as with guest speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created for the Summer Institute will be released open-source (find materials from the 2023 edition [here](https://github.com/fellennert/sicss-paris-2023)).

Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially junior faculty from neighboring institutions near Palaiseau, France. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 9-day program, which includes 5 days onsite and 4 remote, but we are open to alternative arrangements for faculty members.

Application materials are due on **March 15** and admission decisions will be sent out by e-mail by April 1<sup>st</sup>.
