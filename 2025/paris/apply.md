# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career-stage faculties from Europe and Africa. Advanced Master students may also apply. We explicitly encourage applicants from all backgrounds, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

To reduce our collective carbon footprint, and since there are SICSS sites all over the world, we have a no-fly policy (scholars from the African continent are exempt from this). This means that we will not accept applications from people who will travel to Paris from different continents than Europe. Moreover, we will not provide travel grants for other means of transport than trains.

Housing will be provided free of charge for around 20 students for the onsite days. If you can manage your own accommodation during the onsite period of the summer schools, please do add this information when applying, as this will increase your chances of being selected. In addition, we will be providing limited, needs-based partial or full reimbursements for the stay. If you wish to apply to this funding, please make this specific request when applying.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across different levels of technical experience. The language of instruction will be English, for which a good reading and speaking command is necessary. Participants need to be familiar with programming languages, if possible R or Python. Courses will be mostly taught in Python, but participants with little experience with coding in Python will have the opportunity to receive some training prior to the summer school, along with help during the summer school. Participants with less experience with social science research are expected to complete additional readings in advance of the summer institute (material will be provided). In addition to experience with/interest in CSS, we will evaluate applicants along several dimensions:

* Research in the area of computational social science
* Likelihood to benefit from participation
* Contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
* Likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
* Potential to disseminate computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research

When selecting the applications, we will take into account the applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Paris, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Paris if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

Unfortunately, no. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
