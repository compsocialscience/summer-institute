From June 16 to June 20, with an optional additional week from June 23 to June 26, 2025, UCL Computer Science will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, in partnership with Imperial College Business School. The school will be held in UCL Bloomsbury campus in London, United Kingdom. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures by invited keynote speakers, workshops by faculty and early career researchers, and participant-led research projects. Key themes of SICSS-London will be economics, behavioral sciences, law, and LLM based agents. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially junior faculty from neighboring institutions near London, United Kingdom. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to attend and participate in the entire first week. The second week will be dedicated to projects and can be done remotely or in-person.  

Application materials are due on 23rd of March 2025.
