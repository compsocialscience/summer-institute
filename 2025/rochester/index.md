University of Rochester is holding the 4th chapter of SICSS in Rochester, NY! From May 12 to May 23, 2025, Goergen Instite for Data Science at the University of Rochester will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at the University of Rochester. University of Rochester is globally known for its academic strengh in political science and economics. Sessions and lectures are planned to take place in-person. 

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, tutorials, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include:

* image as data
* text as data
* generative AI
* social media / use of APIs
* data visualization
* webscraping
* mass collaboration
* network analysis
* ethics
* introduction to machine learning
* introduction to deep learning

Students will have ample opportunities to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, TAs, other participants, and visiting speakers. We are hoping that the event will have a catalyzing effect on the research and teaching productivity of the participants. Since we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

**[Application materials](https://forms.gle/mXCCgogAuTjrVfkZ8) are due by Friday, March 28th, 2025.**

Participation is restricted to advanced undergraduates, Master's students, PhD students, Postdoctoral researchers, and assistant professors (within 7 years of their PhD). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.
